    "description": "Includes - 28 pages of rules, one 24\" x 24\" map-sheet, 17 Control Sheet Diagrams, 1 Combat Reference Diagram, 180 counters.  An intermediate-level game of tactical space combat.  The Designer's Notes state Starbattles is a game that was originally designed as a modification of another game, but meant to be a separate game.\"  That other game is clearly Task Force Games' Starfire.  The ship component system here is similar, but components are positioned on a hex diagram rather than being written in a single line.\n\n",
