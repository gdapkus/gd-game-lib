Everyone simultaneously tries to &quot;connect&quot; seven of their nine cards. Two cards are connected when they lay adjacent to one another with a pair of symbols on one card touching a matching pair of symbols on the adjacent card.&#10;&#10;The first person to lay down seven cards in that manner shouts &quot;Ubongo&quot; and earns 10 points, while everybody else scores as many points as they have connected cards on the table. (If any player has made a mistake while placing cards, including the player who ended the round, that player scores zero points for the round.)&#10;&#10;For the second round, players flip over their nine cards and use them. For rounds 3-6, players receive cards from two new decks. After six rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u7_n1ct1wa9xkV73od1L8w__original/img/GBl921hnNeoxyFaKZZ2UWWon0UI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic927742.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u7_n1ct1wa9xkV73od1L8w__thumb/img/zVJlyhUOMBS-8XMY0B2_XQoIPJo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic927742.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/93472","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.00129","averageWeight":"1.0714","boardGameRank":"13029","mechanics":[],"categories":["Card Game","Puzzle"],"designers":["Grzegorz Rejchtman"]}}
