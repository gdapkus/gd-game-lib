You can place as many tiles as the total symbols depicted on your Seishi tile and any or all of your Growth cards. Each symbol will let you place one tile of the corresponding type.&#10;&#10;During the turn in which your bonsai matches or exceeds the requirements of a Goal tile that is still in the middle of the table (i.e., the Goal tile has not been claimed yet by any player), you must immediately choose whether you want to claim that tile or if you want to renounce it in order to try to achieve a harder Goal tile.&#10;&#10;When the last card from the deck is revealed, the game end is triggered. Each tile in your bonsai is worth a certain number of points.&#10;&#10;In the solo game you can try the Additional Scenarios that change some rules and goals, and eventually try to beat the Emperor Challenge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Bm5_VZARWmb5sa2Vd-9nQ__original/img/Np58Wz9tBGioa8b2AqjASQgDrl4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6961607.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Bm5_VZARWmb5sa2Vd-9nQ__thumb/img/netlb06OfwpKM-22kVT9klcvC6I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6961607.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/366994","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"3"}}
