By using cards and influence markers, they influence high-ranking Court attendants, such as the King's Mother or one of the countless Royal mistresses. Naturally, the Sun King himself has a special role here too.&#10;&#10;An excellent time and a high level of tension are guaranteed. The final outcome is in doubt right up to the end. Each game is different. A change of pace but still a highly promising strategy game in the finest Alea tradition, one that sits at level 5 on the Alea complexity scale.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TsxO4Iggn_kKRMBlR14gJg__original/img/y74HCBcfAABuZUy6kFc9PbFq1HM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic63296.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TsxO4Iggn_kKRMBlR14gJg__thumb/img/fqur7wJo01qzNKMPAbd2yYHO0pY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic63296.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/13642","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"100","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"100","bestAtCount":"4"}}
