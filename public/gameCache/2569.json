Game hens, pheasants, ducks, geese, and turkeys seem to be always hungry - never getting enough to eat. In Pick Picknic, a real feast awaits them! The fox is also always hungry and ready to eat, but from a somewhat different menu,... Chickens, geese, and ducks, become happily plump when they are able to eat well and often. Such is not different for the clever fox, who will eat all manner of incautious fowl... At the end of the game, the player who has gotten the plumpest poultry and the most nutritious corn is the winner!&#10;&#10;Stefan Dorra's remake of Razzia with the theme centered around chickens and their quest for corn.  But watch out, there are foxes out there trying to get to the chickens.&#10;&#10;One of those &quot;children's games&quot; that adults find fun as well.
