In addition to bringing new abilities such as Hellfire and Trail of Destruction, the Deathwing Space Marines offer an expanded use for the support tokens found in the base game. From an Apothecary that can use his Support Tokens to assist his wounded brothers, to the relentless Interrogator-Chaplain who is able to give a fellow Space Marine any Support Token he spends, the Deathwings make optimal use of the Support action.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3kQDcYxRF9pP9BdPKQWZRQ__original/img/MhwPZ3JdMIlQYNwHQcgwSssOhlw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1331841.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3kQDcYxRF9pP9BdPKQWZRQ__thumb/img/-Hg4RapEe-hIkkc3hbBo3sAM6tg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1331841.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/120965","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
