Creation and Control pits a new wave of enigmatic Shapers against the latest and greatest of Haas-Bioroid's developments in artificial intelligence, efficiency, and security. The first deluxe expansion for Android: Netrunner The Card Game, Creation and Control introduces 165 new cards (three copies each of fifty-five individual cards) that will instigate dramatic new strategies and high-stakes battles for the control of valuable files and the futures outlined within them.&#10;&#10;Creation and Control focuses on the struggles between the executives at Haas-Bioroid and those Shapers who are driven to tinker with their programs and hardware by an almost-religious compulsion, but fans of every Android: Netrunner faction will find plenty of great uses for their influence, as well as twenty-seven neutral cards (three copies each of nine individual cards) that can sharpen the focus of any deck.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PU8uTHpNaawqeuk3HuAHlw__original/img/R6VXO1pemsvGXuBH0L_mgAGzkqg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1639594.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PU8uTHpNaawqeuk3HuAHlw__thumb/img/rOxv9Q7Wid1VHsXu3HflSHrRKSY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1639594.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/139596","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
