Look to all sides for help as you never know where it will be!&quot; Can your team survive long enough to finish all chapters of this exciting story?&#10;&#10;FLEE is a cooperative game of escaping for ambitious puzzle solvers.&#10;&#10;You start a Fast Forward game without reading a rules booklet in advance! Just grab some fellow gamers and discover the rules while playing. The Fast Forward series uses the Fable Game system introduced in Fabled Fruit: With the presorted deck of cards you will discover all cards and rules as you play. It will take several games of FLEE before your group has explored the entire system. It can then be reset and played again by the same or different groups!&#10;&#10;FLEE is  the third of four completely different games in the Fast Forward series!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z-DnsBlUekkyC9X5NMfdVw__original/img/oyijIK3JcRF3IHsUV7VxljhLXj8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3652034.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z-DnsBlUekkyC9X5NMfdVw__thumb/img/ospPuX6IxK3O9XyQjjAmFMe-sV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3652034.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/231666","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"5.7731","averageWeight":"2.2581","boardGameRank":"9093","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Hand Management"],"categories":["Card Game","Fantasy","Puzzle"],"designers":["Friedemann Friese"]}}
