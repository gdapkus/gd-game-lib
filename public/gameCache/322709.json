Your patrons are rowdy and rude, but they are the only ones around. In order to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.&#10;&#10;In The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you&rsquo;ll be tasked with managing your patrons&rsquo; various needs to ensure they all get a good night&rsquo;s rest. Each turn, you&rsquo;ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something&rsquo;s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there&rsquo;s no trouble. There&rsquo;s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!&#10;&#10;After you've run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. Do not include patrons in the bar. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you&rsquo;ve won! If you have less than 7, then you have lost.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hPZdbeObUhy5wJ2vV9xUrg__original/img/RMGcR2TRvLM2ypGUOj55HJn53Gg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5836225.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hPZdbeObUhy5wJ2vV9xUrg__thumb/img/ClHLUQ_yUy5eXM3W-M9Hm4BkNQE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5836225.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/322709","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"6.761","averageWeight":"1.6316","boardGameRank":"3315","mechanics":["Card Play Conflict Resolution","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Card Game","Print & Play"],"designers":["Scott Almes"]}}
