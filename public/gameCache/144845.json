The games are primarily two-player hex-and-counter wargames.&#10;&#10;In War of the Ring, great armies battle while individual characters from the books control the fate of the One Ring. The &quot;character game&quot; can be played separately, to reduce playing time and complexity, and there is also a three-player scenario.&#10;&#10;Gondor is based on the siege of Minas Tirith along with the battle outside the city gate as depicted in J.R.R. Tolkien&#039;s novel The Lord of the Rings.&#10;&#10;Sauron is a simulation of the Battle of Dagorlad, from the 2nd Age, between Sauron and the forces of the Free Peoples (elves, men, and dwarves) outside the main gate of Mordor.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztrcd4iMhNoto_pZkDIePQ__original/img/hUj2eacPPvCGnGXYm_Q93C9L2HA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6186134.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztrcd4iMhNoto_pZkDIePQ__thumb/img/QtZoY1f_MPgK9BVZoU9fqWvK_o4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6186134.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/144845","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"3","yearPublished":"1977","playingTime":"210","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"210","bestAtCount":"2"}}
