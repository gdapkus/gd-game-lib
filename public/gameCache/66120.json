They must bring new animals into their zoos and arrange landscape tiles on the grounds. Points are awarded at the end of the game for both. Zooloretto Mini is a standalone game with simpler rules, shorter game length and fewer components.&#10;&#10;Zooloretto Junior, released in 2016, is identical to Zooloretto Mini except for a few changes: different cover art, no bag to hold the tiles, and the inclusion of a panda disc instead of a panda figurine.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vQ8kDf0Sa8Ul_AUhgkjEcA__original/img/Dhu9RQutwrHiBPxlWJvOiouxXoc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2835287.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vQ8kDf0Sa8Ul_AUhgkjEcA__thumb/img/Yc4H3hdtWMSgBcY9jXLScs6QJ_k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2835287.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66120","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
