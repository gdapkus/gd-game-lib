    "description": "Tic-Tac-Toe is the modern American rebranding of the game previously known as Noughts and Crosses. It&rsquo;s still known as Noughts and Crosses throughout the U.K. A very old game where each player attempts to place three of their markers (usually an X or an O) in a line on a 3x3 grid.\n\nAlthough some may claim that the Romans called this game Terni Lapilli, this does not appear to be true; Terni Lapilli seems to be a distinct and separate game. It shares the board but the players only have 3 pieces each. The same game may be played not on the grid spaces but on lines where it is aka Three Men's Morris.\n\n",
