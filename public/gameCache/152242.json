The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dncdxD1g4dxMh9e8oKlzbg__original/img/o-44FqDtvZ28uqX_V_rcpEnzqsI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1878492.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dncdxD1g4dxMh9e8oKlzbg__thumb/img/Wd1gXoEgJjq9vG3ZCP8_H1hP2eE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1878492.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/152242","minPlayers":"5","maxPlayers":"75","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"11"}}
