More important, what makes your friends laugh?&#10;&#10;Each round, you'll have two minutes to create funny answers for a randomly generated riddle. But know your audience: One player will be judging answers instead of writing them! The judge's choices for the two best answers earn points. When the game's over, tally up your points to see who's the life of the party.&#10;&#10;Give it a whirl! How would you answer the question:&#10;&#10;What do you get when you cross a lion with a pizza?&#10;&#10;Or if you were the judge, which two of these answers would you reward?&#10;&#10;-Pride in Service &#10;-Could I have that with extra antelope? &#10;-A real meat-lovers pizza! &#10;-In the jungle, the quiet jungle, the pizza sleeps tonight.... &#10;-Extra cheese, pepperoni, hold the courage &#10;-Junk food that people are scared to eat&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/87rz8EB_HWTa93Gipt42kg__original/img/qdABWHr790x07reMdRP627tpVGk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic94682.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/87rz8EB_HWTa93Gipt42kg__thumb/img/uG1bbYPBdLdFciy22LK-1UIhl9g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic94682.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/10559","minPlayers":"4","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"6"}}
