Each turn the players move their ships from port countries to one of the areas.&#10;&#10;After all ships have been moved, a battle occurs.  After a number of rounds, until one side or the other retreats or loses all of his ships, the player with ships left takes control of the area and a scores a number of &quot;Points of Control&quot;.  (Exception:  German U-boats only have to survive one round anti-submarine combat and may stay in the area, even if the area has Allied ships.  The Allies cannot score if a U-Boat occupies the area.)&#10;&#10;Additional points are also earned for convoys successfully crossing the Atlantic to England or Russia (for a BIG three POC).&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/55o2quSQUBl1dKQAYRRq3w__original/img/eonFN0AYotuNBnrALaCQ98phz18=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic497221.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/55o2quSQUBl1dKQAYRRq3w__thumb/img/GIO_w_IYdt8Im-2V05WDwEsvvYY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic497221.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1431","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1976","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.55908","averageWeight":"1.9556","boardGameRank":"4148","mechanics":["Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Simulation"],"categories":["Nautical","Wargame","World War II"],"designers":["John Edwards"]}}
