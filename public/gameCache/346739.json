The bar is crowded, the inn is rapidly filling up, and you are going to have to take drastic measures &ndash; but opening up the adjacent guesthouse. The Little Beak, the quaint little guesthouse next to the Inn, is technically liveable and has been free of pyro-rats for several days now. Might as well open it up and collect a few extra coins!&#10;&#10;When selecting a patron at the bar to go to to sleep, you may now add that patron to the Little Beak guesthouse instead of the inn.&#10;&#10;When a patron is added to the guesthouse, the guesthouse is checked for irks from the top down. The regular inn is not checked.&#10;&#10;To win, The Little Beak must have 3 patrons at the end of the game. However, there is a twist. The guesthouse can only have, at most, one of each quirk (noise, fight, smell) in the guesthouse.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-ZGa92FCJM5zHndyt7GmwQ__original/img/8QY_TLzMFggwkeOi5eHR_ED59P0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6589723.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-ZGa92FCJM5zHndyt7GmwQ__thumb/img/LRUl5vCJnwztYHGqDnV6c1UttXY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6589723.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/346739","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":null}}
