    "description": "Based on the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook \"Work\". Reading the book may be of some assistance in playing the game but is not necessary.\n\nExample questions:\n\n\"How to Identify a Nightmare Workplace\"\n\n\"How to combat Eye Strain from Fluorescent Lights\"\n\n\"How to Survive if you're caught surfing the web instead of working\"\n\n\"How to stop an overflowing toilet in the executive washroom\"\n\nMay be used as a travel game or as a supplement to other games in the series like the original or Travel version.\n\nEach one of the cards has a question and 3 alternative answers printed on front and back, 108 questions in all.\n\nThe  current player has the question and all answers read to them. They then choose which of the answers is *most* appropriate.\n\nThe first person to get 5 questions correct is the winner.\n\nThe cards are printed different colours blue/white on their opposite faces which makes it easy to tell when you have gone through the first half of questions.\n\n",
