    "description": "A card game about Japanese geisha by Seiji Kanai.\n\nPlayers take the roles of various geisha, and compete with the other players to win the legendary title of \"Mai-Star\". Use the characters surrounding you to increase your popularity, and earn money by attracting guests, the more demanding the better.  Focusing only on increasing your popularity won't earn you any money, yet failing to spread your name won't make the rich or helpful guests come your way. \nIt's a matter of deciding which characters (cards) will help you increase your popularity and which character cards you want to attract as guests. \nOnce a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and all cards remaining in your hand become minus points, thus depleting your hand of cards quickly is important. Only the one who has attracted the richest guests (earned the most money) after three festival nights (rounds) will be the one who deserves to carry the title of \"Mai-Star\".\n\nThis game's setting is same as Master Merchant.\n\n",
