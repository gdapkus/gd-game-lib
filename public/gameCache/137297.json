Each card has 2-6 symbols which you must populate with legionnaire meeples in order to complete the card. These symbols are drawn one at a time from a bag, with all players gaining the benefit equally, but interestingly, the bag contains more of some symbols than others.&#10;&#10;So the pivotal skill you'll deploy is in making your choice of which three objectives you'll start the game with (you're dealt six) &mdash; balancing potential difficulty of completion against value of the reward &mdash; and then which of five available objectives you'll add to your plate each time you complete one of your three. The game ends when someone completes seven objectives.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjlNoENOK3z7DO8rpNsofQ__original/img/d3vHnE4G0B4wQj_RhTjOoHLX75M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3532649.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjlNoENOK3z7DO8rpNsofQ__thumb/img/DOPkJkUFO89G83sHjAyfN4pqoE4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3532649.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/137297","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.72966","averageWeight":"1.6376","boardGameRank":"1301","mechanics":["Bingo","Open Drafting","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"categories":["Ancient","Card Game"],"designers":["Paolo Mori"]}}
