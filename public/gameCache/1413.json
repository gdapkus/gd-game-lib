The topic is modern submarine warfare (Mostly US/Nato vs. Soviet/Warsaw Pact, but there is an occasional Falklands War scenario.)&#10;&#10;Each player has one or more submarines and/or surface ships. Each ship is represented on an individual large card with counters showing current contact status and damage.&#10;&#10;Each player plays cards to increase their &quot;contact level&quot; relative to their opponent. Contact level abstractly represents relative position and sonar readings. It is possible for one ship to have a better contact on his enemy than the enemy has on him. When high enough contact level is reached, torpedoes can be fired.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yyMo_NJjbjGxlgo8TQn57A__original/img/xeX7B-vCnvU16y5gmPWjZ2fbVpI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2074738.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yyMo_NJjbjGxlgo8TQn57A__thumb/img/OZgqLvR8gcekUck5mX7S_5tSvKQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2074738.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1413","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1991","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
