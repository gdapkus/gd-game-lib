With this player board tracks for each publisher and for the late and early decade are added. This will allow players to track the progress of these things and unlock usable powers (shopper cards) that are asymmetrical. Each player can only have two shopper cards and you can mix or match them in any way. If you already have two cards and you unlock a third opportunity to get a new card you may swap out cards at that time.&#10;In the Publishers Expansion you get double sided player boards, 25 colored cubes and 24 Shopper Cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJYTzp3b0kUZJV3fkttKfA__original/img/rY2J9ixG6WzzWF9r08JwuXAAM3E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4923066.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJYTzp3b0kUZJV3fkttKfA__thumb/img/IfUR9ZueEVjuM_Ltk9lgqT16nTI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4923066.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/282472","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.35556","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Set Collection"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Music"],"designers":["Eric Alvarado"]}}
