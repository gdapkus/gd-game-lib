Especially when it comes to starting a new business.&#10;&#10;You will utilise your network by seeking protection from influential people and having them be your &quot;patron (Patronus)&quot;. A patron (Patronus) can set up a banquet and introduce you to others who are likely to invest in your business.&#10;&#10;Observe the trade route conditions, movement of your rivals, and examine carefully which person you should interact with. The connections you built here will be the cornerstone of your business.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VtuoqeijrgwRD8Aqi8uAPg__original/img/ChBoWGj_NaiZx_a8asYoXdqR6lM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7264562.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VtuoqeijrgwRD8Aqi8uAPg__thumb/img/MwVHtVqxpOuQ7zE0JgXJWCo0Lis=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7264562.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/377813","minPlayers":"0","maxPlayers":"0","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
