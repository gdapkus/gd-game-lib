Now they try to collect them before the Master notices anything. However, in the maze there are invisible walls and only one of the missing objects is revealed at a time. So they have to make their way through the maze by means of a good memory and lots of skill.&#10;&#10;Each player moves their magician over the board while trying not to bump the labyrinth below.
