    "description": "Caesar's Legions is a medium complexity wargame simulating the Roman campaigns in Germany at the operational level.\n\nPlayers choose from 5 scenarios ranging from Caesar's own Germanic campaigns to the Batavian revolt of 70 AD.\n\nMovement is hex based.  Tactical cards effect combat resolution which is dice based and cross-referenced on a probability table.  Roman units are divided into cohorts.  German units are divided into tribes and enjoy hidden movement when in forest terrain.\n\nThe game consists of a 22\" x 28\" map board, over 400 counters (448 counters), playing aids, 16 tactical cards (2 sets of 1 - 8) and a 16-page rulebook.\n\n",
