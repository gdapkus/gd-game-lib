    "description": "Exit: The Game &ndash; The Enchanted Forest is a puzzle game modeled after escape rooms, and it includes components meant to be folded, written upon, or torn, so it's marketed as a single-use game.\n\nA relaxing walk in the woods takes a very different turn when you suddenly encounter strange fairytale creatures and even stranger puzzles. Will you ever find your way out?!\n\n-- description from the publisher\n\n",
