Once in play, the Mosquito takes on the movement characteristics of any creature it touches at the time, thus changing its characteristics throughout the game.&#10;&#10;A Mosquito itself has no movement characteristics, so it gives no movement characteristics to an adjacent Mosquito. Hence a Mosquito cannot move if it touches only a Mosquito.&#10;&#10;Exception: If moved as a Beetle on top of the Hive, a Mosquito continues to move as a Beetle until it climbs down from the Hive.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Cj11Yvi8MS4-0ZPwkRvsuw__original/img/fO3rZwEkoDJUVcYk1jrp6RjSlRg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic347192.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Cj11Yvi8MS4-0ZPwkRvsuw__thumb/img/gqPscGEJl1n9pwKlZmvgAxNiwRI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic347192.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/30323","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.56869","averageWeight":"2.2452","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Grid Movement","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Abstract Strategy","Animals"],"designers":["John Yianni"]}}
