    "description": "Farmageddon is a frenetic farming game for two to four cutthroat farmers.  Plant big-money crops like Wary Squash or Grumpy Melon, but watch out &mdash; they&rsquo;re a tasty target for other players!\n\nProtect your produce with Crop Insurance or Foul Manure, then hit your opponents with a Dust Bowl or those Darn Gophers!\n\nWill you bring in the biggest bushel of crops&hellip; or will they be wiped out by FARMAGEDDON?\n\n-Back of box blurb\n\n",
