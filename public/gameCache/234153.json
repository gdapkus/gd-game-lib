The gemstone must be moved within the same row.  You may only move the gemstone if there is an empty space in the rock there (in the neighboring space of the same row). If there are multiple empty spaces in the rock on this space then you may select one of them.&#10;&#10;For the bonus tile with the water drop and an X: If you use this bonus tile you may take one water drop off the game board and place it back in the water box.  It doesn't matter whether the water box is currently in front of you or one of the other players.&#10;&#10;Due to production reasons, the bonus tiles in the Advent Calendar are slightly thinner than the bonus tiles in the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bv3WpuX4KG5oQp2ktUtPDw__original/img/rVFOXaZmeGwP5GqH1XEy6poXeQs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3805043.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bv3WpuX4KG5oQp2ktUtPDw__thumb/img/oEmVaDTSSY17CninKwPRdMzmPy8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3805043.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/234153","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"50","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":null}}
