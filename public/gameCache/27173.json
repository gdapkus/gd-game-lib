Despite the nominal &quot;Viking&quot; theme, no actual exploration or pillaging is involved.&#10;&#10;The resources in the game consist of coins and several types of ship tiles, island tiles and meeples.   In each of 6 rounds, a random set of 12 tiles and 12 meeples becomes available.  Players take turns buying and placing pairs of meeples and tiles.   There is no direct player interaction, only indirect contention for resources during the buying phase.&#10;&#10;The most unusual aspect of the game is the pricing wheel, which pairs meeples with tiles and sets their prices.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nQPsaIgIvHiVewkPlSeFLA__original/img/WVqOVRbWwE3skoEB63fy-gHbi1k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1904581.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nQPsaIgIvHiVewkPlSeFLA__thumb/img/r-994ljtk8eekrwvCCRWsbnx3PQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1904581.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/27173","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.24173","averageWeight":"2.5397","boardGameRank":"617","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Income","Rondel","Tile Placement","Victory Points as a Resource"],"categories":["Economic","Medieval","Nautical","Territory Building"],"designers":["Michael Kiesling"]}}
