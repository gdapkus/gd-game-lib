The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VbsvVgEvZ0R5IVTsXaOpZA__original/img/-rC2swsWcP48bydp_qjEp7R2hQM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5933098.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VbsvVgEvZ0R5IVTsXaOpZA__thumb/img/SVQn2EK2j5zmarri0XDyCoVLnQI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5933098.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/145","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"1984","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3,5],"averageRating":"6.36133","averageWeight":"2.2353","boardGameRank":"7472","mechanics":[],"categories":["City Building","Negotiation"],"designers":["Sid Sackson"]}}
