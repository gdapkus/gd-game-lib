Four Battles from World War One","type":"boardgame","description":"A &quot;quad&quot; boxed game from Decision Games that also links its &quot;game system&quot; to two other paired WWI battles  published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine (Mons/Marne #186 and Lemberg/Verdun #198). The boxed game includes the following four battles:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Brusilov Offensive, 1916&#10;    Riga, 1917&#10;    St. Mihiel, 1918&#10;    Damascus, 1918&#10;&#10;&#10;These four battles are all unusual in that they were all very unbalanced matchups. Gameplay reflects that - one player is usually trying to back up and just survive. Command and command breakdown is simulated as well as &quot;breakthrough&quot; attacks and two interesting spins on Artillery barrage: suppression of units and 'cratering' of terrain.&#10;&#10;Comes with: Rules, 2 34&quot; x 22&quot; Maps, 560 Die cut counters&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W7LEIG9VC25vRby08jGg3Q__original/img/5nuVqMfw4TpZxKQ0szvty5Y5fS8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic50582.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W7LEIG9VC25vRby08jGg3Q__thumb/img/GiMRxyLmlY8RZjc-OAHutlMZ00w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic50582.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/10221","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1997","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"1"}}
