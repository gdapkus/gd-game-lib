Five of the possible Seventeen emotion cards will be available each round, and five rolled dice will determine which colors can be used to add those shapes to a Brain Board.&#10;&#10;After 12 rounds, the game is scored, and points can be earned by completing sections of the brain, achieving public goal cards, and meeting the organizational criteria of each color. The one section of each Brain Board with the most unfilled squares will result in a deduction of 1 point for each unfilled square in that section.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6ynl6mPl7bdmFzXkcXnZbg__original/img/ucLxv8gH2ZAgD3D0Vsx7gFAp1gI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7674676.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6ynl6mPl7bdmFzXkcXnZbg__thumb/img/3cucDlwwoYIoSYzhpNpm0_gsxs0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7674676.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/377420","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.25441","averageWeight":"1.8889","boardGameRank":"3260","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Drawing","Line Drawing","Pattern Building","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Dice","Puzzle"],"designers":["Nao Shimamura (シマムラナオ)"]}}
