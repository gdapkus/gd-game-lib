Located here were the main Axis fortifications defending Tunisia, fortifications nearly as formidable as those at Alamein. Had the German-Italian army succeeded in defending, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened and perhaps Allied command would have changed again. The playing pieces represent the actual units which participated in the campaign and the map represents the actual terrain over which those units fought. Rommel at Bay is basically a two player game in which one player controls the Axis forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.&#10;&#10;The two players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. Victory occurs and the game ends immediately when one player has achieved the conditions given in the scenario being played. The other player wins the game by preventing his opponent from achieving his victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The game has two scenarios. The first (Medenine) is a smaller scenario of the battle that was fought March 6th to 8th 1943. The second scenario is the main Mareth Campaign March 20th to 28th.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tYtiPPKWMiuO2qRXDTBsfA__original/img/K5B-dpmP2XJcN_f9in9eMBSlHwQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic333699.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tYtiPPKWMiuO2qRXDTBsfA__thumb/img/xbZZUX2499IgFmMVsiDGQvyxqSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic333699.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/17146","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1984","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
