    "description": "Eric M. Lang and Bruno Faidutti have joined forces to create the ultimate prisoner's dilemma game. Do you cooperate and risk getting outsmarted by a greedy player? Or do you compete and risk losing everything?&#10;&#10;You are pirates who just looted a ship and must negotiate how to split the treasure. There are seven types of loot with values from 1 to 3. At the end of the game, you only score the treasure types you have the most and least of.&#10;&#10;On each turn, open four new treasures: two in front of you and two in front of your neighbour. Simultaneously decide how to split them. Choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Peace (I want the 2 in front of me)&#10;     War (I want them all)&#10;     First pick (I want just one, pick first)&#10;&#10;&#10;If both players choose peace, split the loot evenly. If both choose war, lose all treasure. If both choose first pick, lose all treasure and one of your gained treasure columns.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the Dawn Card is drawn. 15 minutes!&#10;&#10;",
