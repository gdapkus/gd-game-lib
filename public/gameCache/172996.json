For the good of the country, a leader must unite the Scots, Welsh, and Romano-British &mdash; not by conquest but by diplomacy.&#10;&#10;Players are members of King Arthur's court. Whether a loyal knight, a scheming lord, or an ambitious noblewoman, you all have one thing in common: power. As prospective leaders, each player uses their power to benefit the factions, gaining influence among their ranks. The player with the greatest influence over the most powerful faction is crowned the new ruler of Britain.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jsimXx5ON_6ukJyyYAAQlg__original/img/rrPuEEGxQlA2G7ocpocRYw1QYx0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2402804.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jsimXx5ON_6ukJyyYAAQlg__thumb/img/XQQacRgsEJIl4CQ6AFtGeog7LvE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2402804.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/172996","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":"3"}}
