Turns out this summit has a twin. That&rsquo;s twice as much mountain to conquer. Perhaps that&rsquo;s what those Mysterious Statues were warning you about.&#10;&#10;Unsurmountable: Dual Peaks adds 2 Mysterious Statue cards, which count as features when using the difficulty rules. More importantly, mountains now require 2 peaks, which means they also need 2 distinct routes to the top.&#10;&#10;And for all the serious mountaineers out there, this expansion can be combined with Unsurmountable: Big Climb: if you can complete a 15-card mega-mountain with 2 peaks, you&rsquo;ll be on top of the world.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AtrgNW2TDgA_0oEF8nqOQQ__original/img/jztgOJ1kga3O5B4Kz-cFmUv7TJI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6389817.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AtrgNW2TDgA_0oEF8nqOQQ__thumb/img/tKM-4Srq4j7s5j4i-AinjSMuHfA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6389817.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/346902","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.02217","averageWeight":"1.3333","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Chaining","Network and Route Building"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Card Game","Print & Play","Sports"],"designers":["Scott Almes"]}}
