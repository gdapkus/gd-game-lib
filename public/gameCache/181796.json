Now you are in a friendly competition to see which of you can destroy his own social standing most thoroughly.&#10;&#10;In The Prodigals Club, you compete in three separate competitions: trying to lose an election, trying to get rid of all your possessions, or trying to offend the most influential people in high society. You can play any two competitions in combination or play all three simultaneously. Each competition interacts with the other two. To win, you need to balance your strategy and play all the competitions well.&#10;&#10;The Prodigals Club is thematically related to Vladim&iacute;r Such&yacute;'s Last Will.
