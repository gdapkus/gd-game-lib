    "description": "They say you can&rsquo;t take it with you...but the Merchants have certainly tried.\n\nThese captains of industry profit from Peasants and make a tempting target for Criminals. Merchants can be a mixed bag, scoring points for adjacent Peasants but taking a penalty for adjacent Criminals. Unlike most skulls, this can cause an unwary player to actually lose points on poorly-placed Merchants. Keep your eyes on your money or you&rsquo;ll end up buried in debt.\n\n\nMerchants is a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.\n\nThis expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the Merchants. Merchants want to be next to Peasants but avoid criminals.\n\nAdding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.\n\n",
