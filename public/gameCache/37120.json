Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods.  Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don't fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit).  The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points.  Players &quot;pay&quot; points  for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xrem-gEIp1RkIijMwGFp0w__original/img/YDnIS69W_e1ToyR3wC9Wi8nAQUc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic495850.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xrem-gEIp1RkIijMwGFp0w__thumb/img/9bOH45PbObmvWrRYHkEQf6M4QAs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic495850.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/37120","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
