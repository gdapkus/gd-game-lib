Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aEtNj7BH3PDwjOcylyDx6w__original/img/3qds684KEL3fDTVuV3mxydxLhyU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7563283.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aEtNj7BH3PDwjOcylyDx6w__thumb/img/rwsIZDzVir-gRUFkM7OZT2OifHk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7563283.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8203","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.69933","averageWeight":"1.4463","boardGameRank":"1072","mechanics":["Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Map Reduction","Modular Board","Variable Set-up"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Animals"],"designers":["GÃ¼nter Cornett","Alvydas Jakeliunas"]}}
