Runners gain new events while corporate executives look to fund new operations. Players will also find new hardware, resources, icebreakers, ice, agendas, assets, and upgrades. Trace Amount is a perfect Data Pack for fans of bluffing as its many events and operations open new surprises and synergies, and prove in more than one way that a card in the hand is worth two or more actions on the table. And as one might expect, in a Data Pack all about bluffing and surprises, Jinteki features prominently, gaining a new identity.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nmBZ7Wwcx7o2KBlYOHenuA__original/img/g0VQVbIdP1T02CuS7MoGGyl-tGQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3166975.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nmBZ7Wwcx7o2KBlYOHenuA__thumb/img/UMHmhOy0t6cNywgriCnXRF0b_sE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3166975.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/132005","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
