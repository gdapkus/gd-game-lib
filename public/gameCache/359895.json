    "description": "Okay, it&rsquo;s time to settle this once and for all &ndash; who is top dog (or chicken)? Get ready to find out.\n\nSplit into teams, or go one-on-one, then grab your Sling&rsquo;Em&reg; and get ready to bid and flip your way to sweet-tastin&rsquo; victory.\n\nTurn over a Challenge Card, then secretly bid high if you think you can nail it or bid low to avoid it. If both bids match, then it&rsquo;s Flipperama time!\n\nEvery time you complete a challenge, you&rsquo;ll get to turn over one of your Character Cards. The first player to turn over all six wins!\n\n",
