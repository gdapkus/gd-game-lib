From designer John D Clair, players get to control iconic characters from the series and \"burn\" metals to unlock Allomantic powers in fast-paced battles.\n\nMistborn is a standalone deck-building game in which you \"purchase\" cards as you play to build and improve your deck. \"Burn\" metals to activate cards. Each metal has its own strengths: damaging opponents, earning mission points, and manipulating allies. There are multiple ways to win! Defeat your opponents in furious allomantic battles or complete a series of perilous missions before your enemies do.\n\nPlay head-to-head against your friends, or take on the The Lord Ruler in solo or co-op play!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
