    "description": "Strange noises are heard from the Mad Mansion of Doctor Doom. Clouds of all colors come out of the chimney, and people tell weird stories about crazy creatures seen in the forest around the mansion. Help Doctor Doom finish his extravagant experiments to create the world's wackiest and craziest creatures ever seen!\n\nIn Crazy Creatures of Dr. Doom (a.k.a. Dr. Gloom in the U.S. release), all players try to get rid of their cards as cards in hand score penalty points at the end of a round. The player with the fewest penalty points at the end of the game wins and becomes Doctor Doom's new apprentice!\n\n",
