It introduces limit cards that limit the number of cards in a scoring group.  Each Limit Card contains two numbers.  The top number indicates the number of scoring groups that score positive points, and the bottom number indicates the maximum number of cards in a scoring group.  So, for example, a Limit Card with the numbers 5 and 3 mean that players are optimally trying to collect five scoring groups with three cards each.&#10;&#10;It was released as a promo on BoardGameGeek in March of 2012 in an edition that matches the card quality of the base Coloretto game.  This edition includes rules in both English and German.&#10;&#10;It can be also be downloaded for free at www.zooloretto.com&#10;&#10;Home Page &amp; Newsletter:&#10;&#10;&#10;     www.zooloretto.com &#10;&#10;&#10;(German, english, dutch, hungarian, spanish, swedish)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W2z9pQuhZJN9XUTtGGVNKQ__original/img/I1oaqgi-aFZBW--6xNb55aGlcNQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic479937.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W2z9pQuhZJN9XUTtGGVNKQ__thumb/img/ZSFwkJBVVaC-w1_oe5mpTX5Gu38=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic479937.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/42613","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.50717","averageWeight":"1.4444","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Michael Schacht"]}}
