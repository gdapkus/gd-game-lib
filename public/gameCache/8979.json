    "description": "Oodles of Doodles is a high-energy party game where sketching meets speed&mdash;and stick figures totally count.\n\nEach round, one player draws while their teammates guess as many words as they can from a secret list of eight items&mdash;all within a shared category and a tight time limit. Think Pictionary on fast-forward with a twist: you're not just drawing one thing, you're doodling a whole bunch of related things at once!\n\nPerfect for groups and game nights, Oodles of Doodles rewards quick thinking, visual shorthand, and shared brainwaves between teammates.\n\n",
