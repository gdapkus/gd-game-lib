They work to achieve various goals by constructing buildings within the town, adventuring throughout the region, navigating relationships with the mysterious sprites who inhabit the valley, and developing their character-specific professions.&#10;&#10;As an open-ended game, Mythwind has no distinct conclusion. Although many players may find a natural end point to their game at the conclusion of the story, players can continue to play the game for as long as they would like over as many game sessions as they wish. As players progress through the game, their town will develop and grow, reacting to changing seasons and to the members of the community over time. Progress made can be easily saved using the provided game trays, which offer a quick and easy solution for both tear-down of the current game and setup of future games.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__original/img/H66R4AERgf5JoiefCgm195rujzg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6422235.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__thumb/img/R4WLcRpALnl-PJyq7Cvyh0dX2cc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6422235.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/317582","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[1,2],"averageRating":"7.57934","averageWeight":"2.8372","boardGameRank":"2848","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Role Playing","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"categories":["Adventure","City Building","Civilization","Fantasy","Farming","Mythology"],"designers":["Nathan Lige","Brendan McCaskell"]}}
