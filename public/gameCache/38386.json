But watch out, the character cards also cause interaction, making for a surprising and varied game. Only when the points are counted at the end of the game, the victor will be known!&#10;&#10;&#10;Players use cards from their hands to take actions. These are revealed simultaneously and then resolved in a set order. One of the cards allows a player to pick the cards back up into their hand, allowing them to reuse cards previously played.&#10;&#10;Players collect resources and money, and build buildings. Once a building is built, the tile is moved to reveal spaces for workers. These spaces give bonus points at the end of the game. The person with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HEHduHVfdLULQHoWLu-Sqw__original/img/vvyUr2URs5yb6p9dt9kfeXp9TR4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic400762.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HEHduHVfdLULQHoWLu-Sqw__thumb/img/HnBxzNEHY0vivRABnTIRmBR_aPU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic400762.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/38386","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
