Under their influence, one of the larger cities turned into a flourishing center of trade and craftsmanship. The Vikings called the city and its surrounding kingdom &quot;J&oacute;rv&iacute;k&quot;, which is today known as the city of York.&#10;&#10;In the game J&oacute;rv&iacute;k, players assume the roles of Viking jarls. They gather prestige points by trading goods, holding big feasts, funding pillages, commissioning craftsmen and hiring soldiers to defend the city against recurring invasions. The player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a re-design of Die Speicherstadt (2010). In this game, players acquire cards from a card display through a simple yet brilliant worker placement and bidding mechanism to build up their trading empires. J&oacute;rv&iacute;k includes two versions: A base game that is equivalent to Die Speicherstadt, and an advanced game that equates to Die Speicherstadt including its expansion Kaispeicher.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ra--amae3o_y9htpHBusw__original/img/OKpqvuvOjHKnm7K4vjT8jLkl1o4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2888329.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ra--amae3o_y9htpHBusw__thumb/img/P_A3lgncN1-dH-CYtza3pnfKu6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2888329.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/193739","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.78763","averageWeight":"2.3881","boardGameRank":"2237","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Auction: Dutch Priority","Worker Placement"],"categories":[],"designers":["Stefan Feld"]}}
