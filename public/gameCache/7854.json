Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__original/img/Ho4DXQbjk8ze91242SC_L14toxs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2844830.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__thumb/img/2JsnDtb5luvivTuwyHdEkGkxyNs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2844830.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/7854","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.71127","averageWeight":"2.6459","boardGameRank":"241","mechanics":["Catch the Leader","Grid Movement","Pattern Building"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"designers":["Kris Burm"]}}
