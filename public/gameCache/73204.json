    "description": "Shed is a clever trick-taking game for 2-5 players that fully utilizes all of the unique characteristics of the Decktet Game System. Players start the game with a pool of tokens matching the Decktet&rsquo;s suits and then they try to get rid of them through careful trick taking. The first player to shed all of his tokens is the winner.\n\n",
