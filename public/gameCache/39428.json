Then the village will be built as usual. The four new ghosts will be shuffled into the deck and four random ghosts will be removed.&#10;&#10;The tile lets you look at the top 4 ghosts on the deck, put them back on top in any order you like, and receive 1 Tao token of your choice.&#10;&#10;The 5 new ghosts pay homage to 5 real world people involved with the creation of Ghost Stories: Bauza, Provoost, Caumont, Pier&ocirc; and Coralie.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ic7cj9HP5pOQ4CebpItgIg__original/img/JgJLG7FdHMGpdsCEaODIljmXB-A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic409849.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ic7cj9HP5pOQ4CebpItgIg__thumb/img/0KuL6_6RlmP_IexuHC2kFSF5-3E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic409849.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/39428","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
