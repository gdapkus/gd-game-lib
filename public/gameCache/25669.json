There is no board, players simply use an available flat surface.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with six blocks. The start player places blocks of a single matching attribute (color or shape but not both) on the table. Thereafter, a player adds blocks adjacent to at least one previously played block. The blocks must all be played in a line and match, without duplicates, either the color or shape of the previous block.&#10;&#10;Players score one point for each block played plus all blocks adjacent. It is possible for a block to score in more than one direction. If a player completes a line containing all six shapes or colors, an additional six points are scored. The player then refills his hand to six blocks.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw bag is depleted and one player plays all of his remaining blocks, earning a six point bonus. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__original/img/FNi6yap-UmVKX8X6rj0A_YW2q8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic309353.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__thumb/img/APPui4zwBuwAIHXSTW6UxYcY6Ow=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic309353.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/25669","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
