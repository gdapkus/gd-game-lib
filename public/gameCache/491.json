Monasteries are the basic placement, with the goal of securing a majority in a region or chain of monasteries or even decent points from second place. The placement of the Advisors is more restricted as the total number of Advisors in a region is limited by the majority player's number of monasteries. The game is played in two rounds and is very fast paced.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.boardgames-online.net (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;Implemented bonus maps: China, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan, Soviet Union&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.onlinebrettspiele.de/kuk/default.asp?l=en (Against AI)&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     China&#10;     Iwari&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Web of Power: The Vatican&#10;    Web of Power: The Duel&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AQiDnYHjzFh34SOPCNzrHg__original/img/k7n0mXH7EpF3gAZA2q4PZS__UUQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic209855.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AQiDnYHjzFh34SOPCNzrHg__thumb/img/-XcIT5SRD0sJpLwitIKbQfkzmz0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic209855.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/491","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"50","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
