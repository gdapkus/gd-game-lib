After half of your team has seemingly become trapped in the Dreamlands, you decide to force your way into the realm in your physical body instead of traveling there in your sleep. This method comes with plenty of dangers, but it will hopefully prevent you from becoming trapped yourself. But if you wish to enter the Dreamlands, you must first find a key.&#10;&#10;A Thousand Shapes of Horror is Scenario 2&ndash;B of &quot;The Web of Dreams&quot; campaign. This scenario can be played on its own in Standalone Mode or combined with the other expansions in The Dream-Eaters cycle to form either a larger four-part or eight-part campaign. Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s classic short story &ldquo;The Unnamable,&rdquo; this adventure takes you to the most haunted corners of Arkham, where the veil between realms is drawn thin and even the most rational mind may be forced to confront the possibility of a world beyond the one we know. Do you have the composure to hold onto your sanity and save your friends, or will ineffable terrors tear your mind apart?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gYjGYztlrBbQ4-uhtQDTKQ__original/img/OT0myRa8PcmG84-ci6BSfSU0OQY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5054738.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gYjGYztlrBbQ4-uhtQDTKQ__thumb/img/icgendtzqhjSw2Qs7UCnWyJtdaU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5054738.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/288607","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
