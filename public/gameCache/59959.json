One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__original/img/YfHGqQB_HXicZUTY-XgXgpsl_rg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1545654.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__thumb/img/f6VZ_PEr1DAr6oLEjG9PxGFYzmQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1545654.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/59959","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
