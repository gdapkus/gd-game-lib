    "description": "A terrible thing is happening in a local village: Werewolves are responsible for the deaths of many villagers. Unable to determine who amongst themselves are werewolves, they've called in a group of master inquisitors to help sort out this mess before it's too late. That's where you and your team come in. No stranger to werewolf infestations, you know that the best thing to do is to start lynching suspects.\n\nYou no sooner get started on this project when you discover that there's a problem &ndash; Werewolves have also infiltrated your team of inquisitors! Now you're in a serious pickle: You need to save the village while thwarting the werewolves whom are working alongside you...\n\nUltimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination. Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you've still got to outsmart them!\n\nMore specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die? It's in your hands...\n\n",
