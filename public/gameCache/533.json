Lay square labyrinth cards showing fantasy symbols like a griffin, dragon, scroll, key, gems, etc.  When a symbol on the card you just laid is directly connected to one or more identical symbols on other cards, you can take those cards (but not the one you just laid), as long as the labyrinth does not become disjointed.  You only hold 2 cards and draw after laying. The game ends when the draw pile is finished, most cards collected wins.  A children's game that is fun enough as a filler for adults.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l3UUH9kbZmW8AxfwESNPHQ__original/img/mNhQ6BGOVYge-eThck9kDFxUua8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic472535.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l3UUH9kbZmW8AxfwESNPHQ__thumb/img/bGjZ3LgMj6aHDzZTiGgfeYjwa7o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic472535.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/533","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
