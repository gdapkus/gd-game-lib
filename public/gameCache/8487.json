The ants are stiff with a short tail and folded down the middle so the legs touch the ground while the body is up. By pressing on the tail and letting your finger slide of the ant will jump, sometimes quite high. Players simultaneously try to jump their ants into the dog&rsquo;s pants. The first one to get all their ants in wins.&#10;&#10;This is a great children&rsquo;s game and promotes excellent hand eye coordination. Many parents may find it difficult to beat their own children at this game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XSbuQDxUKkhNaBCTmNR0oA__original/img/jl7ueeAnVZGSSNqypuC1A4y47YM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic45458.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XSbuQDxUKkhNaBCTmNR0oA__thumb/img/sm6wTIPeixNCddFMXMOReuws0n8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic45458.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8487","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1969","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":[1,2],"averageRating":"4.24941","averageWeight":"1.0588","boardGameRank":"27319","mechanics":[],"categories":["Action / Dexterity","Animals","Children's Game"],"designers":["Marvin Glass"]}}
