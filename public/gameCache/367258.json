Make camp periodically to acclimatize or you&rsquo;ll be too sick to complete the climb.&#10;&#10;This 6-card expansion introduces Camp cards. Two of these are dealt at the start of every game and both of these camps must be reached sequentially before the summit. Making camp requires aligning two specific features horizontally adjacent. Players with the Big Climb expansion can even combine it with Acclimitization, drawing three camps instead for a massive multi-stage hike.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNOWosEcQkThycpn0LUC0g__original/img/rNjSmLdddPAOf8Gn_yBPze6CnYM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7282420.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNOWosEcQkThycpn0LUC0g__thumb/img/2SEo71JqjkTc4U8ePWClwgKnE3I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7282420.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/367258","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"1"}}
