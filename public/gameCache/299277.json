From game to game, players' empires will advance, reaching new eras, goals, technologies, discoveries, and provinces. (You don't need to play the campaign in a set group of co-players as each empire can develop at its own pace and represent different stages of advancement.)&#10;&#10;This meta-expansion includes 220 new cards divided into three types: Provinces, Goals &amp; Achievements, and Technologies &amp; Discoveries. In addition Imperial Settlers: Rise of the Empire shortens gameplay from five to four rounds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mdUoVlnfKcdY9jjaDH-4ew__original/img/Jx0UI0pgqnXY09aBT4m11CZuquw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5191901.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mdUoVlnfKcdY9jjaDH-4ew__thumb/img/EemoVc_JcMTCBphWSqCEO05ef14=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5191901.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/299277","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"1"}}
