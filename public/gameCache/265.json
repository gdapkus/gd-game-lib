Players are seeking positions in the other families' businesses, and to further that pursuit players offer bribes.  However, once accepting a bribe, the 'bought' player is under absolutely no obligation to honor the highest briber or any other verbal deal.  In a word, this game is vicious.&#10;&#10;The new AMIGO edition came out in 2005.&#10;&#10;The main difference between the F.X. Schmid and the AMIGO versions are that the the F.X. Schmid version uses five houses/buildings per player, with values of 1,2,3,5, and 10, but the AMIGO version uses four buildings/houses per player, with values of 1,3,6, and 10.  Accordingly, the F.X. Schmid version has five professions - knight, merchant, lawyer, writer, and clergy - but the AMIGO version retains only clergy and writer, and adds chemist and doctor.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l8ki305GFjjmrRworLUzLw__original/img/8Gjm0OPOkdkuZBovbvB951n_g0g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic182825.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l8ki305GFjjmrRworLUzLw__thumb/img/UZGoQD08li-O011CJNu3LQyusYY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic182825.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/265","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"1994","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"5"}}
