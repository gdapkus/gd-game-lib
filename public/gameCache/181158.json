The bandits now have horses that they can ride to move faster between the cars, and these horses allow them to jump into the stagecoach as well. The stagecoach is protected by a guard with a shotgun, but a punch in his face would be enough to eject him toward the roof of the train. From there, though, he will annoy the bandits on the roof.&#10;&#10;Once the stagecoach is free of the guard, the bandits can collect a new strongbox. Inside the stagecoach, they will also find some hostages who will be worth a ransom at game's end. Careful though, as each hostage has a negative effect that will annoy the bandit for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Horses &amp; Stagecoach also features new round cards and a new event to add more fun to the game. Whiskey flasks spread inside the train also enhance the faculties of the bandits.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/movEptUmjne5GnbJ5z9--A__original/img/S0dIfJ0o1f-_UrsfxrYodIVVXHs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2602731.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/movEptUmjne5GnbJ5z9--A__thumb/img/J-cNdj8ZETBpeFfPQhCxBE6TRaE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2602731.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/181158","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
