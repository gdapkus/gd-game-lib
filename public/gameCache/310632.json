After centuries of war they defeated their age-old enemies the Dragons. Moving to the surface, the Dwarves built magnificent cities and won renown for their heartening beer.&#10;&#10;But the Dragons have returned. Now, the Dwarves must remember their roots, clear old tunnels, and return to ancient caverns while fighting their primeval foes.&#10;&#10;In each of three rounds, custom dice are rolled onto the mountain. You are a Dwarf hero, drafting dice for your hoard. Scores are tallied after each round before you re-roll your dice and the mountain is refilled.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Dice Miner is a game about drafting the dice you covet, adding them to your hoard, and pushing your luck to build massive combos and score as many points as you can.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K03e7G5PaII4S5ILIWPNfw__original/img/kXFUOkYDQFfay31uUBmwSPe6y6E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5440150.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K03e7G5PaII4S5ILIWPNfw__thumb/img/qfEKfhMLEFqXYQAtcbOTEcfhSGo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5440150.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/310632","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
