Tiles alternate between building tiles on one diagonal and landscape tiles on the other. As soon as a building with your house is surrounded, you get 1 point if all the landscapes match, but you lose 1, 2, or 3 points if 1, 2, or 3 of the surrounding landscapes do not match. You can remove your house to reduce this loss, but at the end of the game, you get 1 point per house on your longest diagonal group of houses.&#10;&#10;Reimplementation of:&#10;&#10;    Contra&#10;&#10;&#10;(With different rules.)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XNgWx8vqH8pBiyNjnnOaxA__original/img/TdsP-u_FsfTnFwVckkY-j23bQ0U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic870253.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XNgWx8vqH8pBiyNjnnOaxA__thumb/img/SUcQ8u-Kc6ITQ2nT0Ge6TD6qUfI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic870253.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/16499","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"5.55313","averageWeight":"1.6148","boardGameRank":"21685","mechanics":["Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Ancient","City Building"],"designers":["Michael Schacht"]}}
