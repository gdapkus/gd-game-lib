Add a couple of systems like targeting computers, incendiary munitions, or radar.  Mount all of this hardware on a unique chassis, like a hovercraft or a helicopter, and then team up and battle it out with other kriegbots on a tactical terrain map.  \n Kriegbot is a game for 2 to 6 players, which takes an hour or two to play. It is designed by Matt Eklund of Sierra Madre Games. It comes with rules and technology background, 6 plastic robot figures, 40 plastic markers, 92 color design cards, 6 color vehicle templates, 3 special dice, and 1 color map.\n\n",
