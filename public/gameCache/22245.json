On your turn, play a card from your hand to move characters or use the powers of the Wizard and Jester to influence the position of the King and his Court. You can then move the Crown between the two Duchies, according to the position of each character. The first player to welcome the King or the Crown into their Chateau immediately wins the game! If the King can&rsquo;t decide, make sure he ends up in your Duchy at the end of the game to get his final approval!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x4s694EfCpt7MtxAwzRDuQ__original/img/hM_5x6NHVIO4fOccB4ggsqbb2rY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5854330.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x4s694EfCpt7MtxAwzRDuQ__thumb/img/YeqqzGqiMeAWOGNZlWUv607i9ZY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5854330.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/22245","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.71181","averageWeight":"1.6624","boardGameRank":"2198","mechanics":["Hand Management","Track Movement","Tug of War"],"categories":["Card Game","Medieval","Movies / TV / Radio theme"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
