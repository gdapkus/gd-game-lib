These new minion pieces will replace the generic ones from the base game.&#10;&#10;From the Kickstarter: The Dragonkin Minions are made up primarily of the brutal Dragonkin themselves. These ancient creatures are half-man/half- dragon, with hard-scaled skin that deflects arrows and blades in combat-- making them the toughest warriors of the Dark Lord&rsquo;s very formidable army.  Controlling the Dragon-Kin are the Dragon Mages, powerful wizards casting ancient Dragon Spells to protect the armies of the Dark Lord. The Dragonkin Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Dragonkin Minions and 5 Dragon Mages, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vgPSv_ysjeg-cqkhk2O7IQ__original/img/j1EefWunamb1Zez8MRPyXT5ty1w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2246295.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vgPSv_ysjeg-cqkhk2O7IQ__thumb/img/vZYEluT_IStcR8KJlqbXLPvWXVY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2246295.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/146283","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null}}
