A year later, his family remembers his humor, warmth and &ndash; especially &ndash; his love of fishing. You play a member of his family going out on a solo fishing trip. With a specific sporting goal in mind, you&rsquo;ll recall lessons and memories from Leland. If you piece together the lessons in just the right order, you&rsquo;ll have a great day on the lake!&#10;&#10;In Fishing Lessons you&rsquo;ll play through a series of rounds representing the course of your day. At the start of the game you&rsquo;ll pick a family member, each with their own unique goal. During each round you&rsquo;ll recall a new Lesson, adding it to your list of steps that you&rsquo;ll then run through in order. Lessons are used to move your character&rsquo;s boat along the row of Lake cards or to flip Lake cards to hide or reveal the fish you need to complete your character&rsquo;s goal. Meet the goal at the right time, based on your chosen difficulty level, to win the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qWdoTT-kTVyS6xvU7wCmbQ__original/img/QRj9nXc8ppQwzsqfpDIozCw3Nz8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6898255.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qWdoTT-kTVyS6xvU7wCmbQ__thumb/img/PSBxz7bwDXzp-fyaAJvYPxflv_A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6898255.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/346742","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"1"}}
