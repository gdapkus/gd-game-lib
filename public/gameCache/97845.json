    "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker: Another Big Expansion is just as big as the Big one: New tiles, new support team to be hired to enhance your shipbuilding experience, new ship classes, including huge IV ships.&#10;&#10;Yes, you may also fly round IV, and you can be sure the cards are extra nasty there &ndash; especially the intruders that board your ship, wander around, and eat or blow up your stuff, unless your heroic crew beats them. Wait... that's a different game, right? Aren't we speaking rather about Space Alert now? Well...it seems this &quot;let's board a ship and eat its crew&quot; mode spreads pretty fast in the known universe these days, as with this expansion, it can happen also in Galaxy Trucker.&#10;&#10;",
