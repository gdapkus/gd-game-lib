These Orders consist of the Galactic Senate, the Science Guild, the Merchant Alliance, the Mining Coalition, the Order of Knighthood, and the Mystic Brotherhood. The Galactic Orders expansion focuses on these six independent organizations and their influence upon a galaxy at war.&#10;&#10;Each Galactic Order is represented on the table by a large Galactic Order card that specifies the special power associated with that Order, and each player starts with 20 Faction Tokens that match the Faction symbols on their Starting Decks. Whenever a player deploys a Unit or plays a Tactic with a Galactic Order icon on it, he gets to place his Faction Token onto the corresponding Galactic Order card. Players must choose between leaving their Faction Tokens on the Galactic Order cards to score points at the end of the game, or removing their Faction Tokens in order to use the unique special powers associated with each Order.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sP2p4ExP5zxKtr05GJVVtQ__original/img/hitMdjDvEKDR9e8S2JQ-v3lkxwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1377006.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sP2p4ExP5zxKtr05GJVVtQ__thumb/img/5dQ8nuek98039o_tXX5RbiiOX9M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1377006.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/125099","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"3"}}
