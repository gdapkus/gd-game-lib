    "description": "18MEX is an 18xx game set in Mexico, designed for 3-5 players and playable in 3-4 hours. Like other 18xx type games, it is a rather abstact simulation of historical railroad operations and financing, this time with a setting in Mexico. Players compete to control railroads while attempting to accumulate the greatest net worth. 18MEX features private companies, minor railroads, major railroad corporations and a government railroad, the NdM.\n\n",
