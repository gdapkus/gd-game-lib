Collect and curate! Score by filling up and carefully theming your art museum!&#10;&#10;In this fast-paced card game, you collect impossibly valuable works of art and put them on display in your own personal art museum, the Mus&eacute;e. The only problem is that your opponents are doing the very same thing! Each gallery must be organized properly by exhibit number, but to succeed you must balance your passion for order with the need for public acclaim. Impress visitors by tastefully positioning works of art side-by-side showing similar themes. Make sure you don't get too greedy for applause, though &mdash; doing so might disorganize your collection and keep you from displaying any more paintings. The first player to complete each separate gallery will open the exhibition early and receive extra recognition. The player who displays the most compelling combination of artworks in the most artistic manner wins.&#10;&#10;Mus&eacute;e includes sixty unique fine art images from artists ranging from the fifteenth to the early twentieth centuries, all licensed through Bridgeman Art Library.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S6dzLYuwDsYvzreZ8UAapg__original/img/4FoenCbSNEgzrpuu1-L9glS_v8w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2088837.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S6dzLYuwDsYvzreZ8UAapg__thumb/img/fjXBTIZGJYt1vCcuHjLjaB3GuLs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2088837.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/163056","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
