    "description": "Battle Masters is a fantasy miniatures battle game by Milton Bradley, presumably licensed from Games Workshop.  The sizeable game box comes stuffed with tons of plastic miniatures, a deck of combat cards and some dice.  Players move and fight their armies based upon what card is turned over from the deck.  Combat is held on a large vinyl mat 4.5 ft square (Actual Measurements: 55 inches by 57 inches).\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\nWelcome to the world of Battle Masters - the epic game where you command mighty armies locked in a legendary conflict of good versus evil!\n\nThe noble Imperial Army is ready to meet the Forces of Chaos. You and your opponent must strategically guide 25 army units, featuring over 100 finely-detailed figures, across the gigantic 4 1/2' X 5' Battle Mat. Beware! Ditches, marshes, river fords and the great Border Tower lie before you.\n\nThe battle unfolds as each turn of a Battle card tells which army units can move and which can attack. Will your army be victorious, or will your opponent destroy you? Who will survive the battle and win the game? The fate of the Empire is decided by you, the Battle Masters!\n\nCard Deck:\n3 Goblins and Orcs\n1 Goblins, Beastmen and Wolf Riders\n2 Goblins and Wolf Riders\n5 Champions of Chaos and Wolf Riders\n2 Champions of Chaos Charge\n1 Chaos Archers and Champions of Chaos\n2 Beastmen, Orcs and Goblins\n1 Goblins, Champions of Chaos and Beastmen\n4 Choaos Warriors, Champions of Chaos and Chaos Archers\n1 Choaos Warriors, Beastmen, Orcs, Chaos Archers and Goblins\n5 Wolf Riders Double Move\n1 Whole army move (Chaos)\n5 The Ogre Champion\n\n4 Imperial Knights\n2 Lord Knights\n2 Imperial Archers\n6 Imperial Knights and Lord Knights\n1 Men-at-Arms and Imperial Archers\n4 Men-at-Arms, Crossbowmen and Imperial Archers\n4 The Mighty Cannon\n1 Whole Army Move (Imperial)\n1 Lord Knights and Imperial Knights Charge\n1 Lord Knights Charge\n\nOgre Champion cards:\n3 Ogre Moves\n3 Ogre Attacks\n\nMighty Cannon Tiles:\n1 target tile\n4 flying cannon ball\n3 bouncing cannon ball\n2 explosion\n\nNote!
