Everyone starts with four containers, each of which allows a different grouping action:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Group herbs of same type&#10;     Group different types&#10;     Group pairs&#10;     Group any three types (same or different)&#10;&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw a herb, then decide to either keep it in your personal collection or put in into the communal pile. If kept, the next card goes to the communal pile; if placed in the communal pile, the next card goes in your personal collection.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can decide to use a container. If so, you assemble cards from personal and communal spaces, group them, then turn them all over. You have then &quot;collected&quot; those and can't use the container again.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, collectors determine the best collection as a combination of value from their collection, matching herbs, and herb sets.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0HHqYFhJvOwk8Z0Dt-EvTA__original/img/PUZECnFJTnvhRL48lpUzR5TR48w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7083274.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0HHqYFhJvOwk8Z0Dt-EvTA__thumb/img/EwiBLR6QywbISk0aGe-Vya4zXws=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7083274.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/195314","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"4"}}
