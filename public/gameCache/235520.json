Next, place access points to the Sky Islands &mdash; the beanstalk and the stairway &mdash; on different regions on the game board. Whenever a race stands on one of these access points, they can try to conquer the space on the sky islands that shows the matching symbol.&#10;&#10;Races can't start their conquests in the Sky Islands unless their power specifically allows them to do so. At the end of a turn, if you control all of the regions on a Sky Island, you gain one additional coin.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvXNcK_y4FY_0luh8xF3dQ__original/img/5UcOHeoH6DJrHuP9e6N00tlhHNo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3740948.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvXNcK_y4FY_0luh8xF3dQ__thumb/img/ssdjPibHPBNLmCpd6aEhrYl4cj8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3740948.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/235520","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":"4"}}
