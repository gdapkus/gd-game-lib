The Marine player utilizes a limited number of Action Points to command the Forlorn Squad, hoping that luck and a timely rush of adrenaline will help them to complete their desparate mission with at least a few survivors. The Xeno player has no such worries, as the single-minded horde relentlessly presses in from all sides, fearlessly confronting the human's advantage in firepower, proving that quantity has a quality all its own.&#10;&#10;This low-complexity, quick-playing game includes two shipboard maps and rules for two-player and solitaire play. Tight, tense, and gripping gameplay will have players making whatever sacrifice is called for in this ultimate battle for survival aboard a contested space station. Can you lead Forlorn Squad on the missions necessary for humanity to survive? Or will the Xenos prove too numerous to stop their relentless destruction? Play Forlorn: Hope and find out.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0maT39kgl0FP9iGD-sQwAA__original/img/3ie5P4Nk9Gq3aOuWPoVg6b2mMWY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic653044.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0maT39kgl0FP9iGD-sQwAA__thumb/img/3WJlVPPtbIbQKTdzZ-kLycn_Dgg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic653044.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/57803","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"1"}}
