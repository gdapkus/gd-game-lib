Houses are built with the seal of one of 4 families; this family gave the building order and will get the building player its seal.&#10;&#10;These seals can be changed for victory points. But seals are subject to changing values. The growing castle (every time a house is built, players also build on the castle) has the 4 seals on it as well, which decides the value of each seal. The castle is also the game's timer: once the second layer is built, the last round starts. The player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;Released: Essen 2006.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/poTEdGkJ1951xlYazQXp8A__original/img/8BJy6N3fPRg0vvE67800H5pJxFI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic193620.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/poTEdGkJ1951xlYazQXp8A__thumb/img/rv_wVbGksLdGa3kzoMlf7x5jtlU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic193620.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/25643","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.9136","averageWeight":"2.5678","boardGameRank":"1363","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Set Collection","Stock Holding","Tile Placement"],"categories":["City Building"],"designers":["RÃ¼diger Dorn"]}}
