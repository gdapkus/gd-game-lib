The mystique, incredible courage, and tragic flaws of the Japanese soldier are vividly portrayed in the tense, exciting games of simulated man-to-man combat which only Up Front presents in such panoramic splendor.&#10;&#10;Owners of Up Front will find the game system extensions included herein to be the ultimate of simplicity and convenience; while adding rich detail to the portrayal of the Japanese and British nationalities, as well as accounting for American marines. Twelve new scenarios depict not only typical SW Pacific encounters, but allow more variations for Up Front's existing European scenarios as the British take on the Germans, or the Russians test the Japanese in Manchuria. Several new scenario types list European variations, thus expanding the scope of Up Front's possible encounters. And of course, the complicated T. O. &amp; E. and capabilities of the new nationalities have been distilled into the eminently playable Personnel cards of the Up Front game system.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 Rule Book (Contains 12 Scenarios)&#10;63 Counters&#10;60 Personel Cards&#10;20 AFV Cards&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OSi0Ckw5dPc2CrpehO8p0g__original/img/2QtGO7JdZ_hjpBr9qEXUu1_G3ts=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic662456.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OSi0Ckw5dPc2CrpehO8p0g__thumb/img/eVPHCmvXwJguQuiBCr8CqcuxNuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic662456.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1573","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1984","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.19283","averageWeight":"3.3393","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Hand Management"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Wargame","World War II"],"designers":["Courtney F.
