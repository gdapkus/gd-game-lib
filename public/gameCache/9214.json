    "description": "Here is a description of the game from Uberplay:\n\nAs brave heroes, the players enter the arena. All players play cards at the same time. The cards are dealt and each card shows a hero in a certain color and a shield in the same or another color.\n\nA card is turned over which shows, for example, a blue hero and a red shield of his opponent. Now all players have to hurry to discard a red hero. If the card shows a yellow shield, a yellow hero has to be discarded and so on. The player who managers to discard all of his cards first, receives a score disc. The one who holds the most cards at the end of the round, receives a consolation disc, which may be an advantage in a later round.\n\n",
