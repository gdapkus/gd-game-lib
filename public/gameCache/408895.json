    "description": "In 103 AD, Rome's important port, Ostia Portus, received large quantities of supplies from all over the empire. This port played an important role in transporting food to inland Rome. As the owner of a large fleet, players lend ships to merchants and aristocrats to expand their business.\n\nIn Ostia Pirates, powerful pirates await players when they step outside the safety of the Mediterranean Sea. Players must collect weapons and soldiers and eliminate obstacles that get in the way of their business. If you can successfully develop a trade route, you can expect to earn enough income to be worth the risk.\n\n",
