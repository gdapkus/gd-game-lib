    "description": "Martian Rails is a railroad building game set on a fictional planet Mars.  Simultaneously, the game allows a world of canals and noble savages, a cold high altitude desert globe, a nearly airless planet, terraforming, nanotech cyberpunk and everything in between from 100+ years of science fiction stories set on Mars.  The game further captures the mood of those stories and the feel of the planet.  The game uses a further refinement of the wrap-around mechanism used in Lunar Rails to simulate travel across a 3D  opposed to a 2D map.  Having to think in 3D wraparound mode adds additional \"brain-burn\" to the Empire Builder franchise... sometimes the shortest distance between two points isn't the obvious straight line.\n\nSee crayon rail games for more crayon fun.\n\n",
