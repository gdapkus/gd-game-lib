These improvement tiles  span all five tile categories: seven SERVICE, two ESTATE, two ESSENTIALS, three PRESTIGE, one SPORTING, and three SPECIALISED tiles (one hybrid, one wildcard, and one prototype tile).&#10;&#10;Search for comets in a Garden Observatory, attempt to launch a Hot Air Balloon out on the East Lawn, enhance your service staff in countless ways, or be anything you  want to be in the Art Gallery! All tiles are thematically sound, fitting the Victorian period.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mPiqhg2vmhu3JjVF2pgzoQ__original/img/u5IuBzcCz1HXVyeXVW3-xzmx1SI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5330365.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mPiqhg2vmhu3JjVF2pgzoQ__thumb/img/B-wyZsD5Tdo-jEsO2nrCWTXCg00=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5330365.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/306634","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
