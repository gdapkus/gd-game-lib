    "description": "Puzzle Dungeon is a solitaire hand management, modular board, set collection game in which you control a monster hunter making their way through a dungeon filled with several types of monsters and their kings.\n\nIn Puzzle Dungeon, the player uses the limited cards in their hand and cards they deal into play from a deck to defeat enemies which are dealt randomly each game to form a unique board. Players are limited by the order in which their cards are dealt and the order of the monsters in the dungeon, so a strong strategy is required to win.\n\nPuzzle Dungeon features twenty double-faced monster cards. The front of each monster card features an average monster of that type: a vampire, a goblin, or haunted armor. The back of each monster card depicts that monster as a monster king. There are four of each type of monster. When the third monster of a type is defeated, the fourth is flipped over to the monster king. Monster kings have punishing abilities and a strong effect on the game.\n\n&mdash;description from the designer\n\n",
