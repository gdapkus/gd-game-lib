The board is just 3&times;4 squares, so the game is rather short. As for how to play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The tanuki moves one space orthogonally.&#10;     The kitsune moves one space diagonally.&#10;     The kodama is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Sh&#197;&#141;gi and can be promoted to a kodama samurai, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi (moving one space orthogonally or one space diagonally forward).&#10;     The koropokkuru is analogous to a king in Chess, except that he can win through promotion as long as it doesn't leave him in check.&#10;     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!&#10;     Unlike in Sh&#197;&#141;gi, you can drop a kodama for mate or have two kodama in a column.&#10;&#10;&#10;The expert version has a larger 5&times;6 game board with each player having eight pieces (3 kodama, 2 oni, 2 kirin and 1 koropokkuru).&#10;&#10;&#10;     The kirin moves equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;     The oni moves equivalent to the silver general in Shogi (moving one space diagonally or one space straight forward) and can be promoted to a super oni, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game also adds more rules from the full Sh&#197;&#141;gi game, in particular:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You win only by capturing your opponent's koropokkuru, not by reaching the opposite side of the game board.&#10;     You can't have two of your own kodama in the same column/file.&#10;     You can't drop a kodama for mate.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Japan Shogi Association created the rules for this game in order for players to learn important concepts in Sh&#197;&#141;gi, such as how to handle the generals effectively, why pawn promotion is so important, and how to mate the opponent's king with successive piece drops.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NdUQVf8TnCCz0DjYBnnmgA__original/img/1fEHOdBLFqEuunTeAeR7zkh9NcU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2749012.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NdUQVf8TnCCz0DjYBnnmgA__thumb/img/aF7sBTBT5x8a7M7H6yF7hfCkjdw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2749012.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148641","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"2"}}
