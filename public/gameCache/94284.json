It is not possible to use more than one white die for this action.&#10;&#10;III Activity Card - Red - The Banquet&#10;&#10;Each red die in the district with the most red dice participates in the banquet.  Gain 1 VP per red die present in the district with the most red dice in it (this district may belong to another player, even the neutral player).&#10;&#10;Event Card - Red - Resistance&#10;&#10;When this card comes into play, it calls for a second red event.  Take this second red card from those set aside at the beginning of the game. The second red card calls for a third yellow or white one.
