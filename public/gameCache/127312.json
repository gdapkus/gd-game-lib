After placing a tile, a player can occupy a room on that tile with one of his three archeologists as long as no other room of the same color is already occupied in that chain. When the chain is closed &mdash; that is, when the chain has no &quot;loose ends&quot; that can be expanded upon &mdash; any archeologists in that chain's room return to their players, and players score 1 point for each archeologist they receive. The game ends when somebody reaches 15 points, and the player who has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KjwXYjbafwDFe7g-3mY3vg__original/img/N7AAvWS2Vh1yV9uU5hiUCwoRbIs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1939155.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KjwXYjbafwDFe7g-3mY3vg__thumb/img/Lfcj8gCZX1GKRn_dMVYhyjCSRxU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1939155.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/127312","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.39391","averageWeight":"2.0714","boardGameRank":"4838","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Pattern Recognition","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Adventure","Puzzle","Real-time"],"designers":["Touko Tahkokallio"]}}
