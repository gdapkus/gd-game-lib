    "description": "The Keyside is a winter boat tile. Receive 12 resources, which arrive on the tile at the end of winter and so cannot be moved from the tile.  The new resources can be scored by other tiles, although not those that require the resource to be transported onto the tile - i.e. those with white hex icons. Debuted at Spiel 2024.\n\n",
