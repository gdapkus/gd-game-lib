    "description": "From the Publisher: \nour games explore the major battles of 1806-07, where the French Army encountered two different opponents with different capabilities, from the leadership-challenged Prussians in Thuringia and Saxony to the chaotic battle conditions in winter against the Russians. Based on OSG's Special Studies, which provide a turn by turn narrative of the four battles. Each game shows the approach to the battlefield on the day before battle. The Jena-Auerst&auml;dt game has both battlefields on one map and allows both sides to re-deploy before battle. Set at the scale of Napoleon's Last Battles-525 yards per hex and one hour turns-the game retains the Command System of Commanders and Corps Officers.\n\nBATTLES SIMULATED\nJENA-AUERST&Auml;DT-13-14 October 1806\nPULTUSK/GOLYMIN-24-25 December 1806\nEYLAU-7-8 February 1807\nFRIEDLAND-13-14 June 1807\n\nDESCRIPTION\nNapoleon's Last Battles system, following Four Lost Battles: 525 yards (480 meters) per hex, 1 hour per turn, 500-800 men per strength point.
