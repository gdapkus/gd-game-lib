Play continues until the first player launches a missile and payload, ie the &quot;war&quot; phase. If the missile isn't destroyed in flight, the struck player must spin to see how much of his population is lost. Play continues until either peace breaks out again or only one player has any population cards left.&#10;&#10;Limited edition booster cards were created in the 90's.
