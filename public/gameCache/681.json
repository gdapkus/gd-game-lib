Each piece has four dichotomous attributes &mdash; color, height, shape, and consistency &mdash; so each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid.

The twist is that your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board each turn.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1985 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e7eP58UJVDA1wC5pWjCPqg__original/img/dzB-D9RT7RUE_nTCZ8qVyAFB5Sw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3488229.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e7eP58UJVDA1wC5pWjCPqg__thumb/img/cC_DGL1tsiIpjuR_IXnQzqSBeAI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3488229.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/681","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1991","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"2"}}
