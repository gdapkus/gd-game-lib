By doing this, players are able to place figures of their color or neutral figures around the table, score certain areas or figures under certain circumstances, and place rings on neutral figures or to move them. The neutral figure bearing three rings is the current king, and the table is always oriented to place this figure in the crown location. A new king can come into power though, which will find everyone sitting in a new location.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after eleven rounds wins the game. Artus has two sets of rules: basic rules for families and casual gamers and &quot;professional rules&quot; for more experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QkwczR22CjBdSswoFB0PvQ__original/img/ykdpvkLwpmddvnrjXgT3weeQY9g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic947044.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QkwczR22CjBdSswoFB0PvQ__thumb/img/1WPF1tiUfesDhWWIZoXEAVM1oVk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic947044.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/92643","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
