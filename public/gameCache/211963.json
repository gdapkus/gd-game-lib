    "description": "In general relativity, an event horizon is a space-time boundary beyond which no matter can escape; it is a \"point of no return\" past which nothing will be the same.\n\nEvent Horizon is also the title of this expansion for Exodus: Proxima Centauri. Designed by Rainer &Aring;hlfors and Andrei Novac, it marks a significant step in the Exodus universe!\n\nExodus: Event Horizon is fully enjoyable when integrated with just the base game of Exodus: Proxima Centauri, but it also works great along with Edge of Extinction, the previously released first expansion for Exodus. Even though all ten modules herein are compatible with one another and can be used together, each represents a new or enhanced experience. While some modules integrate seamlessly, others will surprise and engage you in brand new modes of play.\n\nThe expansion also contains two scenarios that provide brand new ways to enjoy the game, including both cooperative and semi-cooperative game modes, a flexible solo-mode, and a scenario that introduces timed game events.\n\nModule Summary\n\n\n\n    \n         Bonus Actions\n\n         M1\n\n         This module adds additional Bonus Action cards as options in your games.\n\n    \n    \n         Centaurian Resistance\n\n         M2\n\n         The Resistance fleets have been reimagined to better scale in both threat and reward throughout the game.\n\n    \n    \n         Centaurian Outposts\n\n         M3\n\n         Centaurians are actively defending their planets against players who exploit their valuable resources.\n\n    \n    \n         Exploration\n\n         M4\n\n         Surprising events and sudden dangers await those brave enough to explore the unknown worlds.\n\n    \n    \n         New Planets\n\n         M5\n\n         New and exotic planets provide even more variety and choices as you expand the reach of your faction.\n\n    \n    \n         Proxima Centauri\n\n         M6\n\n         Our home star makes an appearance in the game and impacts the planetary system with solar wind.\n\n    \n    \n         Jump Gates\n\n         M7\n\n         Utility structures suitable for both strategic and tactical use as well as emergency response.\n\n    \n    \n         Communication Satellites\n\n         M8\n\n         With a strong communication network, your ships will gain an advantage away from home.\n\n    \n    \n         Energy Barriers\n\n         M9\n\n         Natural pockets of energy which can be both a hindrance and a boon.\n\n    \n    \n         Leaders\n\n         M10\n\n         Employ powerful leaders and benefit from their unique strengths.\n\n    \n\n\nScenario Summary\n\n\n\n    \n         Centaurian Stronghold\n\n         Multi-Player,\nFully Cooperative\n\n         Challenging game mode where the players must work together to eliminate a Centaurian Stronghold megastructure while fighting against relentless waves of Centaurian Warship Squadrons that pursue player ships. No combat takes place between players in the fully cooperative game mode.\n\n    \n    \n         Multi-Player,\nSemi-Cooperative\n\n         Most of the scenario rules remain the same in the semi-cooperative game mode. The players can still collectively lose the game if they fail to eliminate the Centaurian Stronghold. However, both the Stronghold itself and the Warship Squadrons are slightly less deadly. On the other hand, they players are also competing against each other as normal.\n\n    \n    \n         Solitaire\n\n         True solitaire game mode where you can enjoy the full Exodus experience, with or without whatever expansion content you like.\n\n    \n    \n         Event Horizon\n\n         Multi-Player,\nCompetitive\n\n         New challenge mode where the players must attempt to score the most victory points before the planetary neighborhood of Proxima Centauri becomes uninhabitable. Triggered in-game events may end the game a turn or two early, requiring the players to always make optimal use of each turn.\n\n    \n\n\n",
