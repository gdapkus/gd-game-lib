    "description": "Oct. 6, 1973: Six years after the decisive Israeli victory in the Six-Day War, Egypt has armed itself again to reclaim undisputed control of the Suez Canal. This time, with better-trained and well-equipped troops (armed with new SAGGER anti-tank missiles), the Egyptians clobber the Israeli Bar-Lev defense line. Israel must once again scramble the valiant IDF and fight for its very survival.\n\nYom Kippur - The Battle for the Sinai, October 1973 covers the bitter fighting around the Suez Canal during the 1973 October War. Both players must fight against time to win before a ceasefire is mandated by the world superpowers. The tools of the modern battlefield, incredibly destructive weapons like rocket artillery, SAM missiles and airmobile troops, are at their disposal. But despite the bewildering complexity of such computerized weapons, Yom Kippur itself is a simple-to-play, fast and fluid contest.\n\nContents:\n\n    One map\n    280 counters\n    Series Rules\n    Game Rules\n    Two Dice\n\n\nGame Details:\n\n    Unit Scale: Company to Brigade\n    Hex Scale: 2 miles / hex\n    Number of Players: 2 (also solitaire friendly)\n    Playing Time: Varies with scenario played\n    Complexity: Low\n    Solitaire Suitability: High\n\n\n\nPart of the Standard Combat Series.\n\nAlso published in Command Magazine Japan #65 in 2005.\n\n",
