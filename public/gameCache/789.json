When a stack grows over five pieces, pieces from the bottom of the stack are removed to bring the stack back down to five.  Pieces of a player's own color that are taken by that player are reserved to re-enter the game at a later time; pieces of the opponent's color are kept as captured.  Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).&#10;&#10;Sackson includes the game In his 1969 book, A Gamut of Games.  The book  makes a reference to the Whitman Publishing  Company production of 1965, along with reporting that the two-handed version was first described in the October 1963 issue of Scientific American Magazine.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7pDn8gNMqq2dcsU3jjr25A__original/img/l9IdQb0PQene8X3gu-xYzkJFduE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic125970.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7pDn8gNMqq2dcsU3jjr25A__thumb/img/buEso4cVVvDoinSz4_FR90te418=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic125970.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/789","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1963","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2,4],"averageRating":"6.48427","averageWeight":"2.3836","boardGameRank":"4820","mechanics":["Grid Movement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"designers":["Sid Sackson"]}}
