They can be played individually or combined with any or all other expansions for the game. These expansions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    8. The Bells &ndash; The bishop wants a new bell for the cathedral, and the fresco painters can contribute by buying &quot;bell certificates&quot;, gaining prestige (victory points) immediately and additional prestige at game's end depending on how much they contributed relative to everyone else.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    9. The Wall Fresco &ndash; By refreshing sections of a wall fresco, the players can gain fame, glory, and a regular paint supply, thus saving money. What fresco painter would pass up such an opportunity?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    10. The Medico &ndash; The time schedule for restoring the fresco is hard enough to meet, but now the apprentices are taking ill, one after the other. How can you finish the work on time? Only skillful planning and the healing drugs of a traveling medico at the market will help.&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WNuMRwMrq-T6Ptp9uvfJhw__original/img/tpcLFlN85dKsAB9vjuxENecdULA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805672.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WNuMRwMrq-T6Ptp9uvfJhw__thumb/img/jOagbSfYkQ3j--0a8KRUV29YKG4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805672.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148289","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.47131","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Grid Movement","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Renaissance"],"designers":["Wolfgang Panning","Marco Ruskowski","Marcel Süßelbeck"]}}
