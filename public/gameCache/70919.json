Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden.&#10;&#10;In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__original/img/HxMG1z7bIVGCGPI6u6ciVO0Oubk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1912529.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__thumb/img/vz9Ec1xB2b4JJQlZFijUsuCvfkQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1912529.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/70919","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.21042","averageWeight":"1.9756","boardGameRank":"398","mechanics":["Action Points","Contracts","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Network and Route Building","Pattern Building","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Animals","Environmental","Farming","Territory Building"],"designers":["Antoine Bauza"]}}
