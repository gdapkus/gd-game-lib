Each player holds six cards at the beginning. In clockwise order, players play one card each. If it is higher than another card currently on the table, the lower card or cards are discarded and the players who had played the lower cards must draw a new card. However, if two or more players play the same number, the card values are added together.  When it is a player's turn and their card is still in front of them, they can discard it without redrawing. First player(s) to get rid of their cards wins!&#10;&#10;Fuji Flush supports from 3 to 8 players!  A great game for large player counts!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mobPzHA7UwgwiGzr2EVW9g__original/img/OnAGoa0zZvLJWW4GVEyQTmjaYKE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3086849.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mobPzHA7UwgwiGzr2EVW9g__thumb/img/rQmbjRFo3DZhq7ufK3K1UwDI0x0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3086849.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/203430","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"6"}}
