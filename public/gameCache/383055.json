Running two lines on parallel tracks allows for maximum profits, as long as there are enough passengers.&#10;&#10;Second Line is a 4-card expansion for The Royal Limited that introduces additional train cards in a new color and allows players to operate a second train below their first line.&#10;&#10;To play with the Second Line expansion, shuffle all train cards together to begin. Draw one additional card each turn and place cards into either row following the normal rules. Beware: the new grey train cars can only accept passengers that match the number (as well as VIPs). Keep your trains close in length, as you&rsquo;ll lose automatically if one is too far behind when the game ends.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ezVvh9wle4_KUISA2Gksbg__original/img/IlLLuUrcp0B8z-ppESfZm6N3D_I=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8107209.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ezVvh9wle4_KUISA2Gksbg__thumb/img/FTZzIbk8J-4IQIQlqc-TpHRxfgU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8107209.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/383055","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":null}}
