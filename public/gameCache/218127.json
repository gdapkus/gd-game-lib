Place a tile on Olympus Mons, the highest peak in the solar system, to gain three free cards!&#10;&#10;&bull; Hellas, the southern wild, includes Mars' south pole and the enormous seven-hex Hellas crater that just begs to become a giant lake. Building around the pole gives you new placement bonuses in the form of heat and possibly even water.&#10;&#10;Each of these maps consists of new sets of milestones and awards with relevance for that particular map. Place three tiles around the south pole to be a Polar Explorer, for example, or race to have the most estates beside water on Elysium!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7yS40E2oW3JY5_1HpDkmBw__original/img/zrWa0cefvMsa28k7lFuW87Rea8M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3343205.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7yS40E2oW3JY5_1HpDkmBw__thumb/img/nUbQgZ-hG7C8S1xU01rU-0HmIC0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3343205.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/218127","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
