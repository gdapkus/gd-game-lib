It wasn&rsquo;t. In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2000. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &mdash; this time within the US Homeland &mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth takes players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.&#10;&#10;--description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Acd8VhTI7yrwGAYNLReurA__original/img/TX-jVs1cBZsgY_U_vgMYDNrxeU8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic859584.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Acd8VhTI7yrwGAYNLReurA__thumb/img/xhSrUlTrFh9mJVlezWTow3UPUOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic859584.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/62227","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"180","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.5708","averageWeight":"3.668","boardGameRank":"570","mechanics":["Action / Event","Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Command Cards","Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game","Stat Check Resolution","Sudden Death Ending","Tug of War","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Modern Warfare","Political","Wargame"],"designers":["Volko Ruhnke"]}}
