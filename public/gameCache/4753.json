Four lords have come to the capital city, each claiming to be the king's rightful successor. Now the lords are vying for control of the city, for they know that who ever wins the city will win the throne. You and your opponents are playing the feudal lords, trying to secure your claims by surrounding the most important locations in the capital (such as the palace, the royal library, and the wizard's tower) with shops, barracks, and other city districts under your control. Watch where you place your districts, however, because your opponents may build their neighborhoods over yours, or worse - send the dragon to burn your territory down. King's Gate is a tense game about tile-laying and destruction.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lPXWs2qNAuDtxY768LkZKw__original/img/QSv9g0l5kNPNoDc0wI19yMOBHWQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic194870.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lPXWs2qNAuDtxY768LkZKw__thumb/img/7rcD9Cz5cJogJudeJ_WH9vN0bmo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic194870.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/4753","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"3"}}
