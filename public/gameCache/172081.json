Players are unique members of a crew trying to pull off a robbery of a highly secure building &mdash; without getting caught. The building has three floors (4x4 tiles), each with its own safe to crack. Players start on the first floor and have to escape to their helicopter waiting on the roof.&#10;&#10;Players each have three stealth tokens. Whenever they are on the same tile with a guard, they lose one. If any player is caught without a stealth token, the game is over. If players can open all three safes, and escape through the stairs to the roof they win.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cPZZhbehOr-cXE1HRa6T3w__original/img/GAmiCfqQ1UdkVxYw4LAkryGW4dY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2439102.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cPZZhbehOr-cXE1HRa6T3w__thumb/img/snQ34rjbfQk96R_-pljlOetsYC4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439102.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/172081","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.42804","averageWeight":"2.3109","boardGameRank":"374","mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Map Addition","Modular Board","Multiple Maps","Solo / Solitaire Game","Square Grid","Three Dimensional Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Exploration","Maze","Spies / Secret Agents"],"designers":["Tim Fowers"]}}
