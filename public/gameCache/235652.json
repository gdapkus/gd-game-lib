Its sixty new cards (divided between two copies each of five different objective sets), continue to explore the bonds of friendship, duty, and honor that drive many of the galaxy's pilots and soldiers, as well as the fear, hope, and greed that compel others to take action.&#10;&#10;Among these new objective sets, you'll find new units and tactics for the Sith, Imperials, Scum, Jedi, and Rebels. You'll find cards to carry you from the Imperial strongholds of the Core Worlds to the forested moons of the Outer Rim.
