The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)&#10;&#10;The card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.&#10;&#10;Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:&#10;&#10;     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade&#10;     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws&#10;     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff&#10;     Renegade - Be the last person standing&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.&#10;&#10;There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_04xA-d-rfygm0c49HE4vA__original/img/el-4Ilu9DeYunRT3r4TVP8Vy3uk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1170986.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_04xA-d-rfygm0c49HE4vA__thumb/img/P-6cf4TEk7ewzrfP9d-8c-TxAY4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1170986.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3955","minPlayers":"4","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":[7],"averageRating":"6.48906","averageWeight":"1.6318","boardGameRank":"1639","mechanics":["Hand Management","Hidden Roles","Hot Potato","Kill Steal","Player Elimination","Take That","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["American West","Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction","Fighting"],"designers":["Emiliano Sciarra"]}}
