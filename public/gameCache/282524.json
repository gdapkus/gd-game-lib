Imagine living in a place so wretched that it's not plagued by one, two, or even three monsters &mdash; but seven of the most horrifying fiends!&#10;&#10;In this game, you'll come face to face with them all as you work together to rid the town of the maniacal or misunderstood creatures&hellip;before it's too late.&#10;&#10;Horrified includes high-quality sculpted miniatures (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty.
