Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most visitors each season that the park opens.&#10;&#10;Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential visitors, but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors, and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores, but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to attract visitors to your park the good old-fashioned way?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hLJv1A1TwrMrLLIJhVpKVA__original/img/LXqkRZSyg3hRMJlUMm2m83gmi_s=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3429338.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hLJv1A1TwrMrLLIJhVpKVA__thumb/img/cHgvJgF-Gr6mgDKj51uPoqbjHQk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3429338.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/221194","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
