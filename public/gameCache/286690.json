    "description": "In Shinjuku, a strategic network-building and pick-up-and-deliver board game, you build stores in Tokyo and the rail lines to connect them so that you can build the most successful shopping/rail conglomerate.&#10;&#10;Every turn, new customers arrive on the map looking to purchase one of four goods. On your turn, you choose two different actions from: (a) build a store, (b) expand your rail, (c) upgrade to a department store, (d) draw cards as income, or (e) move customers along the rail to stores.&#10;&#10;You start with a hand of four location cards and draw a new card each turn. The build, upgrade, and move actions require that you play a matching location card from your hand. Cards in your hand that match locations where you have previously built a store are wild and can be used to match any location.&#10;&#10;The game ends one round after the last customer has been placed, and victory goes to the player who acquires the most sets of customers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
