    "description": "Simon is a large round electronic box with four player 'press pads' on top.  Each of the pads lights up and plays a tone.\n\nThe game is basically a memory game.  Simon lights one of the coloured pads and sounds a tone, then two, then three, etc.  Players attempt to match Simon by pressing the pads in the proper sequence.  If someone fails, they get a 'raspberry' and are out of the game.  Of course Simon speeds up as the game progresses so it becomes increasingly more difficult.\n\nFor a little less randomness, players can set the game to ignore the computer and perform the sequences themselves adding one colour to each play.  Player 1 can press \"Red\", Player 2 then must press \"Red\" and then adds another \"Red\", player 3 then must press \"Red, Red\", and then adds \"Blue\", etc.\n\n",
