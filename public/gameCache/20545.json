You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative. As a puzzle, Rory's Story Cubes  will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing.&#10;&#10;Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.&#10;&#10;Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.&#10;&#10;The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UPOwo0o_YoIhUjZc7Q4p6A__original/img/6epfPPLB_17WmIUUAvJhk09fY0A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5875448.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UPOwo0o_YoIhUjZc7Q4p6A__thumb/img/TggAE9qq0yvlhgvMtQIEnlC2Zzw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5875448.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/20545","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"12","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"2"}}
