To do so, you have to draft dino meeples and place them in pens that have some placement restrictions. Each turn, one of the players roll a die and this adds a constraint to which pens any other player can add their dinosaur.&#10;&#10;Draftosaurus is a quick and light drafting game in which you don't have a hand of cards that you pass around (after selecting one), but a bunch of dino meeples in the palm of your hand.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JahbLRZ_jEe8P8gisXUtJw__original/img/Ug7yXzMmgpaqcv7B_lNTXsAk7_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4447676.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JahbLRZ_jEe8P8gisXUtJw__thumb/img/XGKi6qBOizS_IdLqOHny-rf0JZw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4447676.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/264055","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.09267","averageWeight":"1.247","boardGameRank":"639","mechanics":["Closed Drafting","Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Animals","Prehistoric","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Antoine Bauza","Corentin Lebrat","Ludovic Maublanc","Théo Rivière"]}}
