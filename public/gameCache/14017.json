Place the tile if it fits, i.e. when water borders water and land borders land. Throughout game-play a fascinating seascape unfolds before your eyes. The size and arrangement of the islands on the board is different in each game!&quot;&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Experience the adventure of exploring unknown islands!  Each game presents new and unique challenges, for the board is different every time you play.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player variant, you and your opponent seek to claim the biggest islands in Oceania.  The most successful explorer is the victor.&#10;&#10;Or you can be your own opponent in the solo variant.  You will seek out larger, more valuable islands as the game challenges you to beat your own record score.&#10;&#10;Oceania is the smaller - but no less exciting - brother of the classic Klaus Tauber game &quot;Entdecker,&quot; also published by Mayfair Games.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     PlayCatan (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WkSvvJr9RTZTJ0memPACow__original/img/UC7H8ld-71bwgKXJuReTw4cwTgI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic65199.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WkSvvJr9RTZTJ0memPACow__thumb/img/JydLyHblgkXg1FhL_EiCCDBRarI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic65199.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/14017","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[1,2],"averageRating":"5.78599","averageWeight":"1.4435","boardGameRank":"9658","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Exploration","Nautical"],"designers":["Klaus Teuber"]}}
