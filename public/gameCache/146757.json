Still, the Rebellion's losses could have been much greater. They were lucky to escape with the majority of their command structure intact, and the very fact the Rebellion was able to continue its liberation efforts after the battle owed much to the GR-75 medium transport and the role it played during the famous evacuation effort.&#10;&#10;Recreate the drama of the Rebellion's desperate escape from Hoth and explore new adventures in the Star Wars galaxy with the Rebel Transport Expansion Pack for the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game!
