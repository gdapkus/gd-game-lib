Each round, players play cards in clockwise order in turns to give them the right to a &quot;cut&quot; of the current deal, the value of which depends on the cards played. When a player has passed twice, he can no longer influence that round. After everyone has passed twice, the round ends, and points are totalled to calculate the value of that deal. Players then earn money for each &quot;cut&quot; or piece of the action that they have, which represents their share of that deal. While playing cards, players can negotiate in order to encourage other players to make plays that are favorable to them.&#10;&#10;After a fixed number of such deals (rounds), the game ends, and the player who has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o0yk_vESfqXVWifWenvccw__original/img/lEscWaUhiyFfOqZmE0aP-nMePBY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1590863.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o0yk_vESfqXVWifWenvccw__thumb/img/5UVcerCV_n4N9hAroXKpBr_4i8A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1590863.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/125605","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"5"}}
