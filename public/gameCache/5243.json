    "description": "Montage is a partnership word game in which each player, in turn, thinks of a word, \"spells\" it on the crossword-like grid using color-coded tiles &ndash; each color corresponding to one vowel and five or six consonants, e.g. yellow is A/B/C/D/Z and green is U/T/V/W/Y/X &ndash; then gives a clue, in the hopes that his partner can guess the word before either of the opponents do.\n\nIn 1992, Joli Quentin Kansil revived the idea behind Montage in ¡Knock-on-Word!, a similar partnership word-guessing game.\n\n",
