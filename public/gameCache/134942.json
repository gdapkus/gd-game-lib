The Card Game is a game of creating and manipulating a deal so you can get the biggest &ldquo;piece of the action&rdquo;. If the cards don&rsquo;t go your way, spoil a deal and frustrate your opponents by turning the deal from a big profit into a big loss. Through cunning deal-making, and favoring your &ldquo;Cousins&rdquo; (and by throwing in some guile and backstabbing too), acquire the most money to prove once and for all that you are &ldquo;The Boss&rdquo;!&#10;The game plays in a series of rounds with each round being a separate negotiation for a money-making deal. While playing cards, players can negotiate to encourage other players to make plays that are favorable to them. After a fixed number of such deals (rounds), the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;(from Eagle Games webstore)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A7Izaz9XCeOghJAZjWXn6g__original/img/3L0bKcbTZiPw0sRmNUSfMLjKQjg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1512495.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A7Izaz9XCeOghJAZjWXn6g__thumb/img/kecCZP-zFEx0So0o8FxT20JUr-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1512495.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/134942","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null}}
