    "description": "The gravity-defying word game!\nKonexi is the 3D word-building game that will have you pushing your luck and on the edge of your seat!\n\nIf Scrabble and Jenga got together and had a bit too much to drink, Konexi might be their \"gift\" nine months later.\n\nTake turns adding letters to a teetering tower of words. Go for longer words &mdash; upward, downward, or sideways &mdash; to score more points. But watch out...the next letter may cause gravity to kick in and a Konexi collapse! It&rsquo;s thrilling fun for the whole family!\n\n",
