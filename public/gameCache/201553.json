Trillions of credits are lost, stolen, or simply erased. Each corp blames the others. Economies, industries, lives collapse. And that&rsquo;s just the beginning.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the Flashpoint Cycle, Android: Netrunner &ndash; 23 Seconds provides us our first glimpses of the Android world after the Twenty-Three Seconds incident. Wounded and desperate, the corps act more aggressively than ever. Even as Runners try to take advantage of the chaos, the corps begin to implement extremely powerful&mdash;often hostile&mdash;ice and operations that come with trash costs. And as the bodies start piling up, they unleash new Terminal operations, like Hard-Hitting News, that are so powerful they immediately drain the Corp's remaining clicks once they're played.&#10;&#10;Trillions of credits, millions of lives, and the survival of the world's largest megacorps&mdash;the stakes in 23 Seconds and the Flashpoint Cycle are as high as they've ever been. Amid the chaos, who will be the first to emerge with a semblance of control? Will it be you?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zrL6EUeB4kZGiVxcf9_etA__original/img/DU1y8LQvuA3vTKiG0XQJ83KIgf4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3048090.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zrL6EUeB4kZGiVxcf9_etA__thumb/img/2gDBqz2UFrXxrUmk44hER2V7c5Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048090.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/201553","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.10254","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield"]}}
