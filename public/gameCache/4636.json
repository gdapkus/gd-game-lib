This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zu0wbezlPB_BcOu_QQJk-w__original/img/t4BL4VexdcFmhaWMDL-LxPqmWWo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic402299.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zu0wbezlPB_BcOu_QQJk-w__thumb/img/-SysBOAX-t1r1kmSZpLK44hsHUM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic402299.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/4636","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.57154","averageWeight":"2.0221","boardGameRank":"1881","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Enclosure","Hidden Roles"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Bluffing","Deduction","Prehistoric"],"designers":["Leo Colovini"]}}
