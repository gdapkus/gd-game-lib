Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.&#10;&#10;On each knight's turn, the knight takes a &quot;heroic action&quot;, such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.&#10;&#10;Moreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...&#10;&#10;But enough words... don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse, and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__original/img/_eAaG7PMaTcj1DpHbmUaOBTisoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic70547.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__thumb/img/QOG1zO0uvqxGTDF9V_OewVPMvNE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic70547.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/15062","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[5,7],"averageRating":"7.10025","averageWeight":"2.5667","boardGameRank":"539","mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Player Elimination","Semi-Cooperative Game","Set Collection","Team-Based Game","Traitor Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Bluffing","Deduction","Fantasy","Medieval","Mythology"],"designers":["Bruno Cathala","Serge Laget"]}}
