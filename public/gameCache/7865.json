    "description": "You have 10 DAYS IN AFRICA&trade; &ndash; touring by plane, car, and on foot. Chart your course from start to finish using destination and transportation tiles. With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outwit your fellow travelers. The first traveler to make correct connections for a ten-day journey wins the game.\n\nTiles are arranged on a player's tray, then a new tile is drawn. It can be used to replace a tile on one of the \"days.\" Then that tile or the drawn tile are discarded face-up to one of three discard piles. Tiles may not be rearranged, only replaced.\n\nYou must complete your journey correctly, connecting by\nfoot - bordering country tiles set side-by-side, \nair - countries of the same color with a same-colored airplane between them, or\nautomobile - a car can drive between two countries and a third country which borders them.\n\nWhoever is the first to connect all 10 days wins the game.\n\nThis is the second installment in the 10 Days in series.\n\n",
