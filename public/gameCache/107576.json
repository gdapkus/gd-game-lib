Now they sit around the fire, gaze in wonder at the tribal matriarch, and wonder how they can look as good as her: &quot;Why is my tooth just hanging?&quot; &quot;Honey, I also want something to make my skin look good.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this expansion for Stone Age, style is the goal as ornaments and jewelry become part of the game &ndash; not to mention a merchant to handle such items. Players can now transform their raw materials into jewelry and other adornments.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes a new location for the village, new cards, and new huts &ndash; not to mention components that allow game play with up to five Stone Age hunter-gatherers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2KFqoe0iZ6dq7Tjuh_8xfQ__original/img/YBKa6CDs1-ydMwOefEObVY36pbM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2455648.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2KFqoe0iZ6dq7Tjuh_8xfQ__thumb/img/nmjegvC9BVWnMSI2605R1RXaXc0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2455648.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/107576","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"7.3757","averageWeight":"2.5315","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Trading","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Prehistoric"],"designers":["Bernd Brunnhofer"]}}
