Players take on the role of investigators trying to uncover plots on the way to confronting a story specific finale.&#10;&#10;The game is gritty and thematic, featuring a series of dark events and story lines (such as the appearance of a caped killer on the streets of London) with a hint of the supernatural.&#10;&#10;The game is broken into a series of stories, usually played over the course of 2 chapters, in which players alternately participate in a timed planning phase where various obstacles and plots are uncovered and then an untimed story phase where players resolve the effects of their planning.&#10;&#10;The result is a tense and truly cooperative experience where players must work together, communicate well, plan effectively, and use the strengths of their investigators in an attempt to stay a step ahead on the mean streets of the city.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/inTWjD_gqnTKOmWpjiWV0w__original/img/6fG67xcl3JLFrLvB2gE7bHG1a-w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3068547.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/inTWjD_gqnTKOmWpjiWV0w__thumb/img/U8tbTUYK0nrIk8lBIVgS4zMXpiA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3068547.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/178134","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.58352","averageWeight":"2.8824","boardGameRank":"4182","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Horror","Murder / Mystery","Real-time"],"designers":["Asger Johansen"]}}
