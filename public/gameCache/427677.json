    "description": "Every season seems to bring a new challenge that complicates your normal routine. Addressing it head-on may help you feel better, as long as you don't ignore your other concerns!\n\nSeasonal Stresses 4-card expansion introduces unique Stress cards. Add one random Stress card above your Tea line at the start of the game. Should you complete the card&rsquo;s requirement, such as having 4 Distracted Tea cards at once, you may immediately use its bonus effect then remove it from play. If you&rsquo;re unable to eliminate your Stress, you&rsquo;ll suffer negative points at the end of the game.\n\n",
