    "description": "Captain your own pirate ship and explore the seas to Plunder other vessels and seek hidden treasure while avoiding storms, ghost ships and the dreaded kraken. An adventurous, fast-paced pirating escapade for the whole family!\n\nFinally - the pirate game that gets it right! Plunder is the card game which combines the many elements of \"euro-style\" games, boyhood adventure, and actual history into a fast-paced escapade about the pirate's life!\n\n- A big game in a little box: cards are laid out to form a different map-board each game. Combines the best features of card and board games.\n\n- New mechanics for strategic randomization, with no dice. Each card has a number which may be played to add to different ratings.\n\n- Multiple paths to victory: plunder ships, explore strange coast lands, and trade goods between ports.\n\n- Combines history (actual nationalities, ports, and ships) with fantastical elements (from the dreaded kraken to the lure of mermaids).\n\nDescription edited from text from the publisher.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     Plunder: The Commodore's Game\n\n\n",
