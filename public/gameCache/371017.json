    "description": "A 6-card combo pack that allows you to combine Agropolis and Naturopolis (to mix farmland with wilderness).\n\nUnlike the original rules for both standalone games, this variant eliminates the use of card-passing. Rather, players shuffle each game deck individually, flipping a single card from each to reveal 2 scoring conditions. Then, a 3rd card is drawn at random from the 6-card combo pack to reveal the 3rd and final scoring condition. A separate card from this pack is used as the starting tile, displaying 2 \"blocks\" from those terrains included in each game respectively.\n\nOn a player's turn, they draw 1 card from each game deck and must choose 1 to play and 1 to discard. In this way, both game decks with run out at the same rate. End game occurs after the last 2 cards are drawn and played/discarded.\n\nPlayers score for the largest 2 block groups from each game, lose points for individual roads, and score/lose points according to the 3 scoring condition cards.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
