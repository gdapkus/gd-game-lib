The three new roles consist of the Body Snatcher, who steals an opponents card and turns it into an alien version of that role; the Empath, who sees certain players indicate certain things with their eyes closed, and can use that information later on; and Nostradamus, who predicts which team will win by first looking at cards and then indicating the last card they viewed in the app, which indicates the team that Nostradamus is on.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w2obuxjHJXiIxxHgUrhIEQ__original/img/mSbEKzrROPeXk1A940iWp7N2EZw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3610104.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w2obuxjHJXiIxxHgUrhIEQ__thumb/img/LHX51AwtTIcWN-xqh5e2_tvxGFs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3610104.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/228578","minPlayers":"4","maxPlayers":"12","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"7"}}
