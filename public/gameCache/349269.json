    "description": "Even in death, some still seek the roar of an approving crowd.\n\nChampions benefit from gathering followers alongside them for one last hurrah. Much like the previously-seen Executioners, Champions score points for connected skulls of a certain type. Connected skulls are those either adjacent to the Champion or in an unbroken chain of the same type. Each Champion is associated with a different group from the basic game. Connect as many of that group&rsquo;s skulls as you can to get the full favor of each Champion.\n\n\nChampions is a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.\n\nThis expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the Champions. Champions want to be next to groups of their supporters.\n\nAdding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.\n\n",
