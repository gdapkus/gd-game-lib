Turning in a set with matching symbols is worth more than the face value of the cards, so set collecting becomes a key strategy.  Purchased companies (the corporation cards) are placed in front of the player according to a matching letter system.  The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.  Scoring occurs whenever a player draws a profit card from the deck.  The game ends when the corporation deck is exhausted.&#10;&#10;Originally published by 3M (3M Gamette Series), re-published by Avalon Hill in its &quot;gamette line&quot; (gamette no. 205) when they took over 3M's line.
