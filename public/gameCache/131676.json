Each tile depicts all or part of a wind rose (AKA compass rose). The red, full wind rose is a new starting tile, and divides the playing area into four fields.&#10;&#10;This expansion was released at Modell-Hobby-Spiel 2012 in Leipzig. Attendees had to go on a scavenger hunt to collect clues which would permit them to obtain the expansion from the Carcassonne-on-Tour booth.&#10;&#10;Short rules:&#10;&#10;    Orange full rose is new start tile and defines the four quarters: SW, SE, NW, NE. &#10;    Blue full rose  (reg. backside) redefines the four quarters.&#10;    Orange quarter rose tiles  (reg. backside) are worth 3 bonus points if put down in the corresponding quarter of the playing field, e.g. the South-West rose tile put down in the SW quarter defined by the current valid full wind rose.&#10;    Appart from that the roses have no influence on the play and the features on the tiles and other points aquired through the tile.&#10;    The blue full and the 4 orange quarter rose tiles are shuffled in the stack at the beginning.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qoEz1gCO2WCyzdYG1rnJRg__original/img/RMLkl1eeMAGaHLrG6IpkXmrfE3I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1441224.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qoEz1gCO2WCyzdYG1rnJRg__thumb/img/Ts-g3DgGhPb09HctiFrxAVr7ZtY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1441224.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/131676","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"2"}}
