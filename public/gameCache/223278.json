Only the best will do! Gorgeous appointments, white stone, surrounded by water, with swans everywhere. Oh, and the Ludwig touch? All the architects must design the palace together. The designer who shows the strongest influence will receive the order to build it.&#10;&#10;In The Palace of Mad King Ludwig, each player builds rooms one at a time in a single gigantic palace. As rooms are completed, a moat slowly forms around the outside. Once the ends of the moat connect, the palace is finished, and the player who has contributed the most to the palace wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, this sequel to Castles of Mad King Ludwig shares a few similarities to its predecessor, such as tile-laying, room rewards, and the magic of watching a unique palace take shape through the course of the game, but the gameplay is entirely different, with no auction, a clever endgame timer that graphically builds pressure for players as the moat slowly closes in around the palace, and a twist on resource management with multi-colored swan tokens being used as currency, points, and the keys to new abilities.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KJTd8G2AFDhpcp9iFMYHpQ__original/img/LkHchuiLw9Y3iLCHM3aG3e5jmZ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3464108.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KJTd8G2AFDhpcp9iFMYHpQ__thumb/img/jS3txzXA_eQ1Y36hfx7vNcLpG7A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3464108.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/223278","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.85779","averageWeight":"2.8","boardGameRank":"2914","mechanics":["Tile Placement"],"categories":["Post-Napoleonic"],"designers":["Ted Alspach"]}}
