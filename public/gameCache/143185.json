To be certain we got it right, this set also includes a new card type fittingly known as &quot;Madness&quot; that each of these groups can use to various effects. Just remember that Madness brings you power but at a price (joking!).&#10;&#10;If you're ready to embrace the creatures beyond the understanding of mortal men, then shuffle up these guys with your pirates, bear cavalry, and others for the most awesome fit of crazed insanity you've had in a long time!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W-wqvges-RJTz3yymQ1lEg__original/img/tJ8daFf-t6wsdY-HMRJfXU28OCc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1673124.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W-wqvges-RJTz3yymQ1lEg__thumb/img/IBk1Gds2j7r2CDcr9bEeNXWq6Z4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1673124.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/143185","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.73641","averageWeight":"2.1724","boardGameRank":"1933","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Take That","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Card Game","Fantasy","Horror","Humor","Mythology"],"designers":["Paul Peterson"]}}
