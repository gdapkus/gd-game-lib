    "description": "Jot is a Scrabble-like game, played on a \"write-on, wipe-off\" board with special pens.  Rather than building words from a limited number of letters, each player first rolls a special die, which serves both to dictate the limits of his/her word, and as a one-minute timer.  (The die itself is pressure-sensitive, and will start timing when rolled.)\n\nPlayers must add letters or words to the existing word-pattern, as indicated by the die.  (For example, a die roll of \"+2\" means they must add two letters to the board, with the result being a still-legitimate crossword configuration.)\n\nA player can always, in lieu of rolling the die, select from a deck of cards that define a general type of thing (e.g. \"birds,\" \"sports,\" \"words beginning with 'R'\") The player must add a word that meets the criterion of the card.\n\nPoints are scored for number of letters in newly formed words, with standard Scrabble-like bonus spaces applying.  First player to set number of points wins the game.\n\n",
