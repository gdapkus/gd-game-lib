Reveal the tokens together with your card in phase 2 and place th tokens on the card you just played. Those supporters have the same effect as a person in a shield on your cards during a contest. Thus you count them to evaluate whether you beat the other players and they have to count them for your display when evaluating if they beat you.&#10;&#10;b) In phase 3 &quot;Contest&quot;, you may use or more previously unused supporters. Put these supporters face up below your display. These supporters are only relevant for your own contest. Other player who initiate a contest ignore you supporters and only count the persons on your card to evaluate if they beat you&#10;&#10;In phase 4 &quot;Draw a Card&quot;, you must remove all used supporters from the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QkcMRUDHHO7lYteks-a2Dg__original/img/6oU_mw7DUAABXTYu_WTqu44iExo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3457295.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QkcMRUDHHO7lYteks-a2Dg__thumb/img/Zmq8dd_HlqPWnNQ_Q-NRISQ6MG8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3457295.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/213289","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"5.9375","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Medieval"],"designers":["Stefan Risthaus"]}}
