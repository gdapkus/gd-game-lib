Players use resources gained in the countryside to build buildings, trade, and craft valuable commodities &mdash; the value of which varies as ships come and go from the harbor.&#10;&#10;In the city, players gain access to actions, with each spot representing the three actions that surround it. This simple worker placement gives way to a deep engine-building mechanism as not only will building around production spaces utilize the houses you've already built in the countryside, but building near other player's houses will re-activate them, giving other players valuable opportunities outside of their turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends once players have placed all their houses. The player with the most points from all sources wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oFFRH_pm2QpxVdb2h4Tgsw__original/img/t-gJfy6fychH-cqQ0vmAqVxOMCI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4329951.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oFFRH_pm2QpxVdb2h4Tgsw__thumb/img/HYWeULaKAQU_8m83O1jxd6bWeoM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4329951.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/253635","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":"4"}}
