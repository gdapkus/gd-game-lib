The players want to keep the village shaman fulfilled for as long as the fire illuminates the shaman, he'll help you in your trading efforts. The other villagers have special skills of their own that you can call on for support.&#10;&#10;Waka Waka is set in the same thematic world as R&uuml;diger Dorn's Jambo, which Kosmos first released in 2004.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Lgdc3T7OAvXVFuZh8AUAQg__original/img/HJv_w-3uULGASN8nLK6yHJ2iCQw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1203965.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Lgdc3T7OAvXVFuZh8AUAQg__thumb/img/i2DGh85xBFFBZEeE68ubIrVfAAU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1203965.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/118025","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
