The four galactic races are the Heisenberg Dynasty (Blue), Freeman Followers (Green), Nation's Pride (Yellow), and Kirikin Swarm (Purple). The former two are available in the game: Prometheus Unchained, while the latter two are available in the only released expansion: Flagship: Coyote Stands.&#10;&#10;In a basic tactical skirmish scenario, each player chooses a race and uses a point system to select their fleet, which must include a Flagship and a Commander. Each player chooses how to align his ships (think rows, similar to Modern Naval Battles), while considering their ship's optimal firepower: Direct and Boarding (typically) at range 1 or Guiding at range 2. Game ends when one player's Flagship is destroyed.&#10;&#10;There are other scenarios available with different victory conditions and formats of gameplay.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Flagship: Coyote Stands&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g9qA0vxPsRjBbhudJcdhjw__original/img/9WxYIPcH0VULMyCWTarWBHBlJlk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic14370.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g9qA0vxPsRjBbhudJcdhjw__thumb/img/vy9u8kRxFaLStHZiYADwzkglgiQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic14370.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2180","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"180","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"6.00966","averageWeight":"2.0833","boardGameRank":"13381","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"],"categories":["Card Game","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Dan Verssen"]}}
