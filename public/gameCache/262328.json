It will allow you to delve deep into the Cleveland suburbs and face corruption at its finest.&#10;&#10;Suburbia is a great way to familiarize yourself with the rules of the game and fully prepare yourself for the demanding campaign from the box. But it is also a perfect scenario for a one-off game session. It is a bit shorter and simpler than the other missions, thus we also recommend playing it with friends who are not convinced to devote more than 15 hours to the entire campaign.&#10;&#10;Suburbia is a standalone case for Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game, previously available only for those, who pre-ordered the game. Now you can play it using files available on Portal Games official website. &#10;You will need a base game to play this scenario.&#10;&#10;Note: The original Print and Play of this case was stand alone, the physical printing requires the base game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U_WOMNnoJquimu1rRUmLAA__original/img/IK3lSx1KmkMUENgXW-fSkzVg_94=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4344543.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U_WOMNnoJquimu1rRUmLAA__thumb/img/Te-TqmeRlNCxgAE4zhScLqXGWBw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4344543.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/262328","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
