    "description": "&quot;Without teamwork, you will never survive. Without betrayal, you&rsquo;ll never win.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cutthroat Caverns is played over 9 rounds, each with a random encounter.  Essentially a game of 'kill stealing'. Each round, any monster encountered will have a prestige value of 1 through 6.  The player that successfully jockeys for position and lands the killing blow gets the prestige value for the encounter.  Some encounters will not have a specific monster, such as a trap room for the heroes to pass through (and in this case, earning no prestige).  The surviving player with the most prestige after the 9 encounters is the winner.  If the players do not survive all 9 encounters, no one wins the game.&#10;&#10;A unique combination of cooperative game play and opportunistic backstabbing.&#10;&#10;",
