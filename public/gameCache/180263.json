You have decided to sail back to the newly discovered seventh continent to attempt to lift the terrible curse that has struck you since your return from the previous expedition.&#10;&#10;In The 7th Continent, a solo or cooperative &quot;choose-your-own-adventure&quot; exploration board game, you choose a character and begin your adventure on your own or with a team of other explorers. Inspired by the Fighting Fantasy book series, you will discover the extent of this wild new land through a variety of terrain and event cards. In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival.&#10;&#10;Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying.&#10;&#10;The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__original/img/jcTlhpYG2496xQtuQ277bFTIldY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2648303.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__thumb/img/_YPdmxegKIoZI_ButuMJzfw9UBo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2648303.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/180263","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"1000","minPlayingTime":"5","maxPlayingTime":"1000","bestAtCount":[1,2],"averageRating":"7.79232","averageWeight":"2.8983","boardGameRank":"126","mechanics":["Area Movement","Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Map Addition","Modular Board","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Card Game","Exploration","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Ludovic Roudy","Bruno Sautter"]}}
