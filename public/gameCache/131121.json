They take turns playing tiles from a common pool until all have been played. Each tile has a unique action that affects the tiles around it, the score, or some other gameplay element. At the end of the game, each player scores points for the tiles showing their side, plus any bonus point tokens they have earned. Win by having the highest score!&#10;&#10;(The beta version of Equinox had only 36 tiles, and players played only one tile each turn instead of two.)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-mIhis8onVgYo5BVOlthjw__original/img/umqkhX4xz6wUpvyDZkOYf5arFfs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1953688.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-mIhis8onVgYo5BVOlthjw__thumb/img/lUOgkOtoV3X90S6qvtTV71dxavw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1953688.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/131121","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"25","minPlayingTime":"25","maxPlayingTime":"25","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.47974","averageWeight":"1.9231","boardGameRank":"8491","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Take That","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"designers":["Jason Boomer"]}}
