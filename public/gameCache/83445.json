One side of this wonder allows its owner to copy specific levels found on neighboring wonder cards, while the other side consists of a single level that requires one of each resource for a single huge payoff in power, points, and the purse.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;     7 Wonders: Wonder Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHZtIT4bSAl0zb_E9rM6TA__original/img/qGDg1fMxePVNzHD0WeKixNslRQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic855117.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHZtIT4bSAl0zb_E9rM6TA__thumb/img/xaOvfqkVFxYEIVHFOBShK9FRFCE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic855117.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/83445","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
