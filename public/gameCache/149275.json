The cove island tile has many small island pieces with a large central waterway, while the bay island tile has a massive block of land that will almost certainly create a large island in the playing area. The six progress tokens add new abilities that players can gain during the game, such as the ability to ignore the pirates once or to take a second action at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j2p3Ispd_hHighcB4au-7A__original/img/M3EAWVbS4RWvMaGoiRyLX166PoU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805719.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j2p3Ispd_hHighcB4au-7A__thumb/img/NLCt-Xoe7lTVKq1pikYajLpeMhE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805719.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149275","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":[2,3],"averageRating":"7.53349","averageWeight":"2.9","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Nautical","Renaissance"],"designers":["Stefan Feld"]}}
