When as many cards for a designer have been laid face up as the number on that designer's cards, that designer has a &quot;breakthrough&quot; and players who played that number save those cards for scoring at the end of the hand (The deck is balanced: more 7-value cards than 6-value cards, etc.). All other played cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;There are 2 special cards for each designer in the deck:&#10;&#10;     A Super Model is worth 2 cards toward achieving a breakthrough.&#10;     An Out card clears all of that designer's face up cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played over several hands until at least one player has scored more than 100 points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MbPwBp79nf2MTNg_U_vjIQ__original/img/z1W9PhLkOQ7_zps0iTIi1L3Ip40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic48652.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MbPwBp79nf2MTNg_U_vjIQ__thumb/img/GkKp-kxM7MaAq9YS9_8P1lVoaE4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic48652.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1412","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"4"}}
