Both jobs require a certain presence, both require a flair for the dramatic, and both require an encyclopedic knowledge of ropes and rigging (sets don't build themselves, after all). That said, acting doesn't pay the bills (like, ever).&#10;&#10;For Zee, the chance to perform his greatest works across the Seven Seas appeared when their troupe was embarked on a voyage to the New World. Their ship came under chase by pirates, who would certainly have taken the hapless merchantman, had not Zee stood upon the taffrail and delivered a glorious ad-hoc discourse on the nobility of all free-thinking peoples in the character of Brutus from Caesar. The pirates, so moved by the amazing performance, threw money, LOTS of money, and offered Zee a job. Zee made his choice, and has never looked back!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-W3x7IdhXyvwWgbqKEY2VA__original/img/DSmLghDS5hzkzgdmLuv5exl-Uho=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3178349.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-W3x7IdhXyvwWgbqKEY2VA__thumb/img/V0iH94m2MY3oAeFC8Gsm1ppjjxA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3178349.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/207116","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":null}}
