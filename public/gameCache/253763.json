Each temple and pyramid they find can reward them with valuable treasures as long as they have control over the tile at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Of course, once found, no player wants to lose their newly discovered buildings, so use caution. The other players are aware of the opportunity that has arisen, and the newly gained fortune may be lost again just as quickly to another player.&#10;&#10;Expedition Luxor is a re-imagination of designer R&uuml;diger Dorn's older family game Robber Knights, with new artwork that fits the world of Luxor and bigger cardboard tiles than the original game. What were knights that conquered the surrounding land are now adventurers who discover temples and pyramids to claim the treasures within.&#10;&#10;Whoever places their landscape tiles and adventurers most skillfully throughout the game will be the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7KlqMnDIYGAPt_bj-ne6Rw__original/img/QZQ3I-yJ3zIG-HUxYwk3a9X3Kzg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4230427.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7KlqMnDIYGAPt_bj-ne6Rw__thumb/img/2MCYUlsGFyP9Ay-XOxlQEgPDd_8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4230427.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/253763","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"5.86943","averageWeight":"1.25","boardGameRank":"15715","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Grid Movement","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Ancient"],"designers":["RÃ¼diger Dorn"]}}
