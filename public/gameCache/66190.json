As in the original game, players collect four types of currencies and use those funds to purchase tiles that they assemble into their own mini-metropolis, connecting the paved street edges on the tiles to create a coherent network of roads. The building tiles come in six colors, and players score for their holdings three times during the game, earning points for having the most of a color as well as for their longest road.&#10;&#10;Aside from the theme change and the associated new artwork, the gameboard is now larger with spots for both face-down and face-up tiles and a scoretrack that circles the edge of the board instead of zigzagging back and forth.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RxSSHNFw-9do_xspRdOr4w__original/img/WONGaIXHfiaPcGyYkO1cScp_Ios=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1118046.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RxSSHNFw-9do_xspRdOr4w__thumb/img/_hthJcbjJ2wVNTRo8US92uEhgjc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1118046.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66190","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.64818","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"5262","mechanics":["Hand Management","Open Drafting","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["City Building"],"designers":["Dirk Henn"]}}
