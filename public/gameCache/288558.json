    "description": "Chu Han is a two-player card game of dynastic intrigue set in ancient China before and during the Chu-Han Contention, 206-202 BCE. Two clans, the Han and Chu, vie to supplant the weak Qin ruler and forge China's first true dynasty. Historically, the Chu began in a stronger position, but the Han managed to defeat them.&#10;&#10;Chu Han is a trick-taking, climbing, and shedding game with special powers consisting of multiple hands. Players begin each hand with a mixture of Chu and Han cards, representing strains within clans, hostage taking, and shifting allegiances. Optional Events and two historical campaigns provide additional variety.&#10;&#10;The goal is to score 31 points before the other player. Can you outmaneuver your rival to found a new dynasty?&#10;&#10;",
