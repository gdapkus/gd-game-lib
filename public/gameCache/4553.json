Each player always has four attribute cards and a red or green sheep card in his hand. One player chooses a topic. All players with green sheep try to play an attribute matching this topic, all players with red sheep try to play one that doesn't match. All played attribute cards are revealed simultaneously and the players must try to slap a topic-matching attribute card played by another player who also played a green sheep. Points are earned for correct matches.&#10;&#10;Expanded by&#10;&#10;     Attribut 2 (Lookout Games, German language)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8mrFKnY4MU5XP2iifmAm9A__original/img/hIRRqekVVfp72eF1J0BG4ntbfaI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic211585.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8mrFKnY4MU5XP2iifmAm9A__thumb/img/Co3ceTtwHQMATy3XyWjDcCxATto=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic211585.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/4553","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[6,7],"averageRating":"6.34707","averageWeight":"1.178","boardGameRank":"4662","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Party Game","Real-time","Word Game"],"designers":["Marcel-Andr√© Casasola Merkle"]}}
