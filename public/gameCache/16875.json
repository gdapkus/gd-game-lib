    "description": "Darter is a quick strategy boardgame in which the players place tiles to affect the movement of 'darters', trying to destroy their opponent's base while protecting their own.\n\nThere are two categories of tiles; Impact tiles, which alter the course of the darter when struck; and Proximity tiles, which affect the darter when it passes through the tile's active squares.\n\nDarter was showcased at GenCon SoCal 2004.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Dragons of Kir\n\n\n",
