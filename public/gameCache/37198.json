The graphics and components are brand new. Major and minor objectives have been added, along with cities and capitals, plus rewards for completing objectives.&#10;&#10;The new version has a drastically changed victory condition: complete three objectives while controlling your capital. This shortens the game playing time to around 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;There are three rule sets: Basic Training, Command Room and World Conquest. Basic Training is an introduction to the new Risk rules and includes a pre-existing setup for 3, 4 or 5 players. Command Room adds a randomized setup and rewards for achieving objectives.
