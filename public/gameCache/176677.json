An additional tile in the game features an impassable chasm, and this tile &mdash; as well as the included mountain markers &mdash; forces players to adapt to new landscapes when moving meeples on the board.&#10;&#10;Five Tribes: The Artisans of Naqala also includes two new Djinns.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QuRGlBr7xR38ihils0sakg__original/img/d7nvhbSByZ4ApS_WD-AnGa7BUUM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2496396.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QuRGlBr7xR38ihils0sakg__thumb/img/ZX21xUn_PdSpxdCmIojjQ0EN1yc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2496396.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/176677","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"8.1205","averageWeight":"2.79","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Modular Board","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Arabian","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Mythology"],"designers":["Bruno Cathala"]}}
