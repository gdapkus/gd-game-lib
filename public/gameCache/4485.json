    "description": "A very funny game where you equip a hotel, hire employees and try to get guests into your hotel. But they are waaaayy demanding, and some may ruin your equipment (like smash the mini-bar) or make your staff resign. And if you are unlucky, the army will choose your hotel for lodging a company (pays bad and destroys equipment).  But if you have all he wants, the sheik might just drop by.\n\nIn the end the hotel with the best reputation wins.\n\n",
