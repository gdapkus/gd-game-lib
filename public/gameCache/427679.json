    "description": "Few things pair together as nicely as a warm cup of tea and a good book. Let the worries of the world go as you settle in for a nice relaxing read.\n\nA Good Book 5-card expansion adds 2 new Tea cards and 3 new Worries to manage. Use a full set of 9 Tea Cards (and correspondingly 9 Worries) to play through a longer, more challenging game. Can you pay attention to both your tea and book through a full 10 turns?\n\n",
