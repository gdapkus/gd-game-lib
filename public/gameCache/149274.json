With this expansion in the game, when a player chooses the red Plan action, he can take one of the four production building tiles instead of a neutral landscape tile; when he uses the green Build action to place this building on an island, he takes one of the five special production tokens available and places it on his player sheet. These production tokens are treated like any other during scoring.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVIflx_3KF5_y66qjJAKOw__original/img/fmQwjRxnHLUfxGwWv_XLSXJCjCs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805723.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVIflx_3KF5_y66qjJAKOw__thumb/img/rbmBpnGITlFutb2yWZCykWN1pJU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805723.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149274","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.3575","averageWeight":"2.8333","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Nautical","Renaissance"],"designers":["Stefan Feld"]}}
