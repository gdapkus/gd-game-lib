After drawing, the active player must take the final card they drew and may select one or both of the previous two cards drawn (if available). They then load these commodity cards on their boat. Cards that are not taken remain available to future players. Once a player's boat is full (seven cards with two players, five cards with 3-6 players), they are out of the round and the day is scored.&#10;&#10;Players score points for the value of their ships' holds, but also for the number of commodities of each type that they have stored in their warehouse. The highest earning merchant over three days wins the game. Some cards do not take up space on ships, while others contribute to the value of a hold, but cannot be stored in warehouses.&#10;&#10;This is the first game to be added to the Medici family of games since Strozzi, released in 2008.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1c6dyk5cBxhTUld9bxRfg__original/img/--N_04JpMCw1R6tPZTVyMAwbYNo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3231000.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1c6dyk5cBxhTUld9bxRfg__thumb/img/JT1IHQaemlaAaPN-Sgkt6gA9h_c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3231000.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/202288","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
