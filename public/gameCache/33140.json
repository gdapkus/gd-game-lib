    "description": "Be quick as you flick, slide or shoot the different-colored hyper discs under the arch. As the game unit calls out the sequence of colors for you to pass, the game knows if you've passed the right disc or not. Pass 'em fast before the buzzer blasts! Obey the voice commands, get your brain in the game and break the code, or guess which color will be called next. Play with a friend or practice solo. Tabletop slide-and-pass excitement features electronic lights and sounds, plus an announcer's voice that talks you through three fast-sliding game modes. Electronic game unit comes with four Hyper Discs, each a different color; plus Hyper Band and instructions.&#10;&#10;The game also has a test mode on which let's you test the discs before playing the game. To enter the hidden disc test mode, hold down the two yellow buttons and either inserting a battery or pressing reset, let go of reset and then slide one of the discs near the bar. You can also keep the lights on, disable them and stop the voice repeating the color.&#10;&#10;",
