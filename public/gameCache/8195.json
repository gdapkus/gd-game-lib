The further the goal, the more cheese (points) it is worth. Pursuing the mice is the cat that removes the mice from the game should it catch the mice.&#10;&#10;Movement is regulated by a die which has 1/1/2/3/4/5 on the sides. The &quot;1&quot; sides also move the cat. Initial cat moves are only one space, but become two spaces after once around the track, so when the cat speeds up, the game is almost all over!&#10;&#10;Viva Topo! is a family game that has players balancing risk and rewards as they attempt to outrun the cat and score for cheese.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/agslhCTZF1YGmq5Qb44YsA__original/img/c-IPFOVHh8s8PCfMLBeMARneDCc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4907101.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/agslhCTZF1YGmq5Qb44YsA__thumb/img/I3d2mP4F7UJ8ZXpJXzVB5QOT2FA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4907101.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8195","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.82772","averageWeight":"1.0783","boardGameRank":"2844","mechanics":["Push Your Luck","Race","Roll / Spin and Move","Track Movement"],"categories":["Animals","Children's Game","Dice"],"designers":["Manfred Ludwig"]}}
