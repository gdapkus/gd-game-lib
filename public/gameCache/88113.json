    "description": "Isaac is an abstract strategy game for two players.\n\nThe game is divided in two different phases, placement and scoring.\n\nDuring the placement, a player places one of his rectangular pieces on the available spaces of a 10&times;10 square grid board.\n\nDuring the scoring, each player removes one of his pieces from the board, scoring a number of points equal to the number written on the removed piece times the number of pieces that lie on the row/column from which the piece was removed. A piece can be removed only if it is at least long as the longest piece already removed by the same player.\n\nEach player uses his/her own counter to keep track of his/her points but the counter itself is placed on the board (that is, the board is also the score track). The presence of a counter on the row/column from which a piece is taken doubles the points scored. A player can decide to score less points than he/she earned, therefore allowing to place the score counter in a more convenient place.\n\nYou can play Foundations and Hari with an Isaac set.\n\nSource: Author's description\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     http://www.iggamecenter.com/ - igGameCenter (real-time)\n\n\nAwards:\n\nWinner of the NESTORGAMES continuous abstract game design contest\nWinner of the Abstract Game Design Contest at the Cald&egrave; \"Tutto &egrave; numero\" Mathematical Festival 2011\n\n",
