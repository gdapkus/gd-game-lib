If you reach the ball you shoot the ball by the unused number of pips on the die plus one, and can make passes between players of your team. &#10;The die makes luck a part of this game. But your choices, like which player you move to which field and where to pass the ball are very important. For the following turns you calculate chances for your opponent and yourself and you try to have your players in good positions for later situations.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G_j6OIHbBPGIa6kDDyvmQw__original/img/UoCsUbu23sy-MAgePJrArhtmdm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic249610.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G_j6OIHbBPGIa6kDDyvmQw__thumb/img/h_C2y0rznSy86QaakECQReh1Lwc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic249610.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3421","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.528","averageWeight":"1.5407","boardGameRank":"3320","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Roll / Spin and Move"],"categories":["Dice","Sports"],"designers":["Corn√© van Moorsel"]}}
