The expansion includes a new faction board, the Atlanteans faction deck, technology tokens, and expansion cards for the original factions that complement the Atlanteans abilities.&#10;&#10;The Atlanteans bring a new resource to the world of Imperial Settlers with technology that can unlock special abilities on faction cards and transform common buildings into powerful allies. The Atlanteans must use their abilities to find unique ways to score because their faction buildings sink at the end of the game and do not score points! While the other factions do not have the knowledge to use the technology of the Atlanteans, some buildings for each faction allow them to use some of that technology to their advantage.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3nxnhWSZyV4BaItfKnanew__original/img/O60NxRRLXTs-YZ1Xh7qQt51VVx8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2520742.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3nxnhWSZyV4BaItfKnanew__thumb/img/FFhgmSaLCz5p4H-gEarfRD6JmyA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2520742.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/177739","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
