When overpaying for a building, players now get partial change back in coins, which you can use as normal money cards.&#10;&#10;With the module &quot;The Thieves,&quot; thief cards are dealt to players in the beginning. The thieves allow players to take available money cards out of turn.&#10;&#10;With the module &quot;The Walls,&quot; wooden walls become available. Players can extend their city walls or close existing holes with them. To build walls, a player must first get an appropriate wall card from the money deck.&#10;&#10;With the module &quot;The Traveling Merchant,&quot; buildings in Alhambra begin to get populated by meeples! The new residents give extra points during the scoring rounds. To get the residents, players must do a little planning ahead with their city layout by using merchant tiles.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aivmMXFXs4S4h5l8-5QECg__original/img/nZ_FzGxD78AdPf2Bh6t5INSpfSw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic253894.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aivmMXFXs4S4h5l8-5QECg__thumb/img/tf0DNKGf8Xf2ulYoSsJExSjFdUI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253894.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/16494","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.99777","averageWeight":"2.3151","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Arabian","City Building","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Dirk Henn","Wolfgang Panning"]}}
