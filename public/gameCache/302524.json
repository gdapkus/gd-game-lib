You'll select one of the two die results, then move your pinball to a bumper or spinner, or target one level below with a matching number. Once you reach the lowest level, pick which flipper's roll to use to send the ball right back to the top. Play well, and you'll unlock bonuses like multiball, score multipliers, and more to help you get the high score!&#10;&#10;The 4-Cade comes with four different tables, each with its own unique art and challenges. In &quot;Carniball&quot;, the intro table, you shoot ducks, pop balloons, and ring the bell in the test of strength! In &quot;Cyberhack&quot;, steal data from an evil corporation and earn Hacks to help you when you activate the RUN mini-game. In &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, return to the 1970s with lots of spinner action as you try to manage the main playfield and a mini-pin at the same time. In &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, take on the role of a young wizard and defeat enemies for big bonuses; hit drop targets to level up, and learn new spells that let you manipulate the dice and trigger bonuses like multiball.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tmm3TEDHjb4daehm9sgstQ__original/img/_gbOQyUrnpHDaK76RA7Fe3ujsZY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5295593.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tmm3TEDHjb4daehm9sgstQ__thumb/img/582BiL1sLioLTCZF0_adtz4kYmA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5295593.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/302524","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.07813","averageWeight":"2.2143","boardGameRank":"1390","mechanics":["Bingo","Dice Rolling","Paper-and-Pencil","Roll / Spin and Move","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["Geoff Engelstein"]}}
