On their turn, players spend action points to put new mice into play, reveal corridors in the castle, move their mice around the castle, or push a tile into play, which changes the maze of cheese pieces underneath. If two of a single player's mice reach a place with the same kind of cheese showing, the player obtains a piece of this cheese. The first player with 4 different pieces of cheese wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mG8NJnDq-FD0Y7706e1E-w__original/img/QL-ddcvEqop7b1pVg5nTfYlZVoE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7054370.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mG8NJnDq-FD0Y7706e1E-w__thumb/img/07rW9zpoQ_Q3OHgikI36G_XzaGw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7054370.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/28089","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
