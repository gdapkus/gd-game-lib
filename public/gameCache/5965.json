    "description": "Strategy & Tactics magazine #61.\n\nThis game is a tactical simulation of combat in the Middle East during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  The game included a map, 200 counters representing Israeli and Arab forces, and a 12-page rulebook.\n\nEight scenarios and two campaign games (which link multiple scenarios) are included for play.  Victory conditions vary depending on the scenario. (e.g.- Victory in 'The Battle of Gamala' scenario is based on victory points; in 'Peled's Counterattack', victory is based on capturing Hill 6 on the map)\n\nExtensive designer's notes and combat examples are included in the rulebook.\n\n",
