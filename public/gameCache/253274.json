After taking either action on a turn &mdash; whether drawing a card or playing a card &mdash; the player can move one of the fish to an orthogonally adjacent space on their game board. (If the fish isn't on the board yet, it enters a space on the outside rings of the player's board.) The two fish cannot be on top of one another.&#10;&#10;When a player places coral pieces on their board, they can't cover a fish with coral. When scoring for a formation, they score 1 additional point for each fish on a formation, which means a player can score at most 2 extra points since each formation can be scored only once.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CR1zCbRtRud765jSSYqoUg__original/img/lsHH99UJSGGiWcaeR1smWKVSSoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4318650.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CR1zCbRtRud765jSSYqoUg__thumb/img/tPYNE3sAKrCL1x_XRH44SSN5Ld8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4318650.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/253274","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
