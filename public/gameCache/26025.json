    "description": "The game involves placing wooden pieces on a tower, each piece consisting of a line of 5 colored cubes in different arrangements, so that each piece touches the piece(s) below it only where the colors match.  The player who is unable to place a piece or who knocks the tower down is eliminated.\n\nThe game comes with a solid wooden plinth to place the first piece on, 60 wooden pieces and a large cloth bag to draw them from.\n\n",
