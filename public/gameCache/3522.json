Each player starts with three chips and on their turn a player rolls the three dice. For each &quot;L&quot; rolled, they give a chip to the player on their left. For each &quot;R&quot; rolled, they give a chip to the player on their right. For each &quot;C&quot; rolled they put a chip in the middle of the table. For each dot rolled, nothing occurs. The dice are then passed to the next (clockwise) player. If at any point, only one player has all of the chips, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Never Say Die&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8rxCRziKeKX4CA6ZfgjuSA__original/img/AEZF9UPbHeerME1njPiLkB7JQvg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2371259.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8rxCRziKeKX4CA6ZfgjuSA__thumb/img/3_c-sKzzNz057gZVPTdPjo2Lpo0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2371259.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3522","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"12","yearPublished":"1983","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"3.65391","averageWeight":"1.0432","boardGameRank":"27420","mechanics":["Dice Rolling"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["(Uncredited)"]}}
