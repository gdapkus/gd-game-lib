    "description": "1833NE (called 1834 in prototype) is an 18xx game set in the Northeastern United States.  The scale is significantly smaller than many 18xx games, and the game includes both standard and takeover versions.  1833NE is most like 1846 (and therefore has a linear stock market, multiple types of trains available at each phase, and paying for most track lays), but adds ferries and takeovers.\n\n",
