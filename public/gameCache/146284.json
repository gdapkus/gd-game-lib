In combat, the Gluttons attack using their long spike-like claws to skewer their enemies and pull them into their gigantic razor-toothed mouths, feeding upon their enemies the way they feed upon the Realm. Deadlier than the Gluttons, the Blood Demons charge into battle wielding a flaming sword that not only burns the body, but corrupts the soul as well.&#10;&#10;Defenders of the Realm: Demon Expansion is a minion pack containing twenty Gluttons and five Blood Demons that can replace the generic minion pieces in the base game. This expansion also includes Minion Cards that describe how these Minions are to be used when playing Defenders of the Realm.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GwruUkp6vk7ndXzb7_j7QQ__original/img/6lkJC3mXaj8-5IpEkCCbDleG6k8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1906198.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GwruUkp6vk7ndXzb7_j7QQ__thumb/img/Ob8p-TswnNGCg3Br-phKxVf7lHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1906198.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/146284","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.73784","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Fighting","Miniatures"],"designers":["Richard Launius"]}}
