Each faction receives five new skills and three new structures, which nearly doubles the amount of unique abilities in the game.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this expansion introduces an alternate game mode that ensures each game lasts for five full rounds. When passing an event token, instead of removing it, new scoring abilities are introduced that allow players even more options to gain victory points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L01qBrwtNmfMYLn1sOR1IA__original/img/npOHWeeVw_tPqBvtmXqaw2838BM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3671707.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L01qBrwtNmfMYLn1sOR1IA__thumb/img/uOQFEvtwp7peTbSrXutcqcFIYP4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3671707.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/210697","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.73645","averageWeight":"3.2","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fighting","Miniatures","Science Fiction","Wargame"],"designers":["Grant Rodiek","Marek Spychalski","Ignacy Trzewiczek"]}}
