Some of our guests are asking for ketchup. Do we have any?&quot; &quot;We don't serve ketchup in this company.&quot; &quot;Also they are asking whether the restaurant will expand anytime soon?

How can I concentrate like this? I need that Michelin star! And this new sushi dish is just the thing. Or maybe if I combine kimchi with ice cream...&quot; &quot;But chef.
