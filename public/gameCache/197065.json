Players want to fill their tombs with food, amulets, and other treasures, and to do so they acquire cards that are laid out in the shape of a pyramid; purchase cards at the base of the pyramid, and it &quot;crumbles&quot; to bring cards higher in the pyramid to the base where they can be bought. The pyramid resets each round with new offerings.&#10;&#10;You score only for cards that you remove from your deck and stash in your tomb, so if you keep using valuable cards for their effects and don't entomb them before the game ends, you could lose out on big points! Whoever collects the most valuable artifacts in her tomb wins.&#10;&#10;Valley of the Kings: Last Rites, the third standalone VotK title, introduces the various citizens and roles of people in the ancient Egyptian kingdom.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4l2AK948M2cdFTg8XoN2Bw__original/img/xMrBpps6tywsp5rnaBu8RGmW3wc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3024378.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4l2AK948M2cdFTg8XoN2Bw__thumb/img/KEeQlZdYYMWOaLa6d_afJ4yuSMU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3024378.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/197065","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
