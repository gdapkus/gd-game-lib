They can hire helpers to use their special effects. They build a barn to store goods and sometimes they need to have a little time off and have a Siesta!&#10;&#10;The dice game singles out the dice mechanism from the boardgame and transfers it into a much lighter game. Every round the players roll the dice and draft them until everybody has at least three dice to score.&#10;&#10;Once a player completes the siesta track the game comes to an end. Whoever collected resources in the most effective way will win the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xn9W-Nf3M2kcM3cuDE6LCg__original/img/QbgSkiQo0b1sfOfskfqUCUA7s1U=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3051552.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xn9W-Nf3M2kcM3cuDE6LCg__thumb/img/ywSZ7luaLuCxQgEXPrI02I2-oiI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3051552.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/195528","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.77995","averageWeight":"2.1892","boardGameRank":"2124","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Open Drafting","Paper-and-Pencil"],"categories":["Dice","Farming"],"designers":["Andreas \"ode.\" Odendahl"]}}
