    "description": "A 6-card combo pack that allows you to combine Sprawlopolis, Agropolis and Naturopolis.\n\nUnlike the original rules for the standalone games, this variant eliminates the use of card-passing. Rather, players shuffle each game deck individually, flipping a single card from each to reveal 3 scoring conditions. Then, a 4th card is drawn at random from the 6-card combo pack to reveal the 4th and final scoring condition. A separate card from this pack is used as the starting tile, displaying \"blocks\" from those terrains included in each game respectively.\n\nOn a player's turn, they draw 1 card from each game deck and must choose 1 to play and 2 to discard. In this way, all three game decks will run out at the same rate. End game occurs after the last 3 cards are drawn and played/discarded.\n\nPlayers score for the largest block group from each game, get -1 point for each road, and score/lose points according to the 4 scoring condition cards.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
