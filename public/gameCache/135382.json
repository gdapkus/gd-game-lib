You don't have much &mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you? You're about to find out.&#10;&#10;Shadowrun: Crossfire is a cooperative deck-building card game for two to four players set in the gritty, cyberpunk fantasy world of Shadowrun. Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge.&#10;&#10;Shadowrun: Crossfire includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, mission sheets, role cards, runner cards, and upgrade stickers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0nfrP1exlJeWbYEdmD9bA__original/img/XKI9_MNe0oqeblKUADHw9n9z4nk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2060466.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0nfrP1exlJeWbYEdmD9bA__thumb/img/-OuMWt8vmQ3l5tPUUVwgvDQ0M78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2060466.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/135382","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.10466","averageWeight":"2.8342","boardGameRank":"1272","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Legacy Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Card Game","Fantasy","Fighting","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Mike Elliott","Rob Heinsoo","Jim Lin","Gregory Marques","Sean McCarthy","Jay Schneider","Rob Watkins (Board Game) (I)"]}}
