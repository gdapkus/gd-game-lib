Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city!&#10;&#10;Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the five districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities.&#10;&#10;Belfort is a worker placement game with area majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind! Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7EoGJIE03X3_Gxw4AcADJQ__original/img/pc6HDj_WGlubFiyo0Ur9z3jXhIs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1368514.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7EoGJIE03X3_Gxw4AcADJQ__thumb/img/kpieGmBNsObVwNDJtvJsAdEPs1E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1368514.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/50750","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
