    "description": "In Endeavor: Age of Expansion, players will take the mechanisms they know and love and use them with a new set of buildings and cards for all-new game play and interaction.\n\nThe new building market creates a totally different strategic experience within the same rule set. Most of the actions on the buildings are familiar, but new concepts include trade, fortify, and conscription & mobilization.\n\nAge of Expansion also comes with a new set of Asset cards. All of the cards feature a new and interesting distribution of symbols.\n\n",
