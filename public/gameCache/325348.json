It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. &#10;By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms.&#10;&#10;Successors is a 2-5 player card-driven wargame based on those wars.&#10;&#10;Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. &#10;Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. &#10;Then Successors III, built on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards, appeared in the Boardgamer.&#10;&#10;The fourth edition of Successors includes more generals, more scenarios, new Tyche cards, plenty of new components, and a changed map, with Libya and Cyrene being merged.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YlDLNXpqv1AKGE_TZsNPDg__original/img/Mcw4pO1nedshcfVjCmRUP4YJjzE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4919647.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YlDLNXpqv1AKGE_TZsNPDg__thumb/img/wgfIrHeXOqRbcT0r0lVp_eFzfTg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4919647.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/325348","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"300","minPlayingTime":"300","maxPlayingTime":"300","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"8.04458","averageWeight":"4.0784","boardGameRank":"2382","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Events","Pick-up and Deliver","Point to Point Movement","Simulation","Variable Set-up"],"categories":["Ancient","Wargame"],"designers":["Richard H.
