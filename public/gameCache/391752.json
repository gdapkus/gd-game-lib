    "description": "In Steam Power, players \"race\" to build the best rail network to meet their contractual obligations and make the most money.\n\nOn your turn, you can perform two actions from a selection of choices, letting you lay tracks, build factories, fulfill contracts, earn money, or collect more contracts. Building a factory brings resources to the board that all players have access to...at a price.\n\nThe game ends when a certain number of contracts are fulfilled, which varies by player count. The player with the most points (and money, which converts to points) wins.\n\n",
