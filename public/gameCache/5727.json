Players then alternate moving units, in a strict order, and have combat.&#10;&#10;Combat is simultaneous.  One die is rolled for each attacking and defending unit... each roll of 6 scores a 'hit'.  Losing player chooses either an aircraft/armour unit or rolls a die for army/leader losses.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who is first to eliminate the opposition's top two leaders. (Allies: Churchill, Stalin; Axis: Hitler, Goering)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ND8k7sW0jI9gjUXEySk2lQ__original/img/r77blieM-PKukWEhVeNijyPFdRQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic21388.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ND8k7sW0jI9gjUXEySk2lQ__thumb/img/xe_OcyfqRr7ZcuQDsC0PyI-JbiE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic21388.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5727","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1985","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
