The city is ever expanding and growing, drawing inhabitants from nearby areas to make Teotihuacan their new home. A glorious new temple has just been constructed, attracting local governors to seek the blessings of the gods as they continue to build and decorate the city. With the rapid progress also come new challenges, as the influx of people and activity demand adaptability to the seasons of change.&#10;&#10;Teotihuacan: Late Preclassic Period is a modular expansion which introduces several new options to enrich and expand the game experience.
