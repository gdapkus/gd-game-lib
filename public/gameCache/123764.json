This TIE fighter variant is produced in very limited numbers and flown only by experienced pilots. The TIE Advanced x1 Prototype was infamously flown by Darth Vader in the battle of Yavin.&#10;&#10;Control the legendary Darth Vader or choose from three additional pilots with the TIE Advanced Expansion Pack. Resourceful and merciless, Vader is so skilled that he performs multiple actions in the same time that other pilots perform one!
