To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats.&#10;&#10;During setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.&#10;&#10;The Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IBn2GPrJuABKSDLczbcSw__original/img/bpAZxXbFJGkJCk4rt79lweDLbqs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5201760.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IBn2GPrJuABKSDLczbcSw__thumb/img/GMlXZU9yt-v7MLYt6Pl6ELG87sw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5201760.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/297175","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":null}}
