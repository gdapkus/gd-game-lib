    "description": "Glen More II: Highland Games expands Glen More II: Chronicles thanks to the inclusion of three new chronicles and a solo mode.\n\nIn Feasts & Follies, players try to outwit the opposing clan chiefs in order to win the upcoming end-of-round scoring by hosting great festivities first.\n\nSticks & Stones, in which the champions of the players compete against each other on the new Highland Games board to take the lead in a new scoring category.\n\nFuntails Development expands the possibilities of the popular Overbuild Tiles many times over with the new Monuments in Plan & Prosper.\n\nNot only are these new Chronicles supported by the extensive Solo Mode by Automa Factory, but also the base game and a total of 11 Chronicles.
