The tunnels are dug deeper and longer through the use of iron. Water channels are implemented to help drain the pit water. Most of the population earns their living exclusively by mining coal and delivering the black gold to peddlers and the first coal barges cruising the river, which gives its name to the valley and the entire area &mdash; the Ruhr.&#10;&#10;This expansion features two new challenging modules and 21 new development tiles for you to explore!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O5400cHsVq3mx488Qweyfw__original/img/Geaw0NwDTqjJPFF95O1Jai0uC78=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3317412.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O5400cHsVq3mx488Qweyfw__thumb/img/uOoLtWw8-Pgb4X6j8_2EFgzfTcs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3317412.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/216718","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
