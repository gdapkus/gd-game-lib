On one side, you find the fledgling Rebel Alliance, led by a few brave politicians and desperately fighting for the hearts and minds of people on countless planets. Opposing the Rebels stands the might of the Galactic Empire, a monolithic government ruled by the Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious.&#10;&#10;Galactic Ambitions pits these two powers against each other in a struggle for the galaxy itself. Like previous deluxe expansions, the twenty-six new objective sets included in Galactic Ambitions fix the spotlight on two factions&mdash;the Sith and the Rebel Alliance&mdash;but every faction receives cards that push your decks in new directions. Here, you&rsquo;ll find an assortment of iconic characters to include in your decks, including Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Leia Organa, and Mon Mothma, Kanan Jarrus, and the Inquisitor from Star Wars: Rebels. Whether you&rsquo;re fighting to free the galaxy or to squelch any trace of resistance, Galactic Ambitions offers new strategies and cards to support new deck types.&#10;&#10;Contains objective sets 217-230.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bQIz07Ukj6bUCSi4A4dNWA__original/img/P5O7PT1kqwZS-WiBNVVBELIqiVI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2904458.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bQIz07Ukj6bUCSi4A4dNWA__thumb/img/8BJg2j4eW1U-Qd-Y9kKcG_EWk-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2904458.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/191525","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.98391","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Erik Dahlman (I)","Nate French"]}}
