    "description": "Glenn Drover&rsquo;s Empires: Ancient Empires utilizes the extremely successful Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery game engine and takes it in a whole new direction. In Ancient Empires, players control one of the civilizations from the Roman era and vie for supremacy.\n\nAmong the elements new to Ancient Empires are agriculture, which determines a player&rsquo;s number of citizens, and the military garrison, which allows players to re-deploy their troops. To be victorious in Ancient Empires, a player must plan well and yet be able to adapt to changing circumstances. It is time for a leader to emerge and become the supreme ruler of the Roman World.\n\n",
