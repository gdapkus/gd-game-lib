Players compete for points in several hands of play by playing sequential pairs, trips, straights and other card combinations, and whoever has scored the most points once the designated point score has been reached wins. Chimera is normally played to 400 points, although longer or shorter games can be played.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y1MBcefOg3bP_cWmGsJwUQ__original/img/bHwcRlqrhxSbihUS54cuFP8MJxg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1958140.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y1MBcefOg3bP_cWmGsJwUQ__thumb/img/Fbnk896sW2_YG1_6BUNqSKsxciQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1958140.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/156373","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"3","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.96994","averageWeight":"2.1667","boardGameRank":"3491","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Hand Management","Ladder Climbing","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Card Game"],"designers":["Ralph H.
