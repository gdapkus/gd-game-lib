Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played.&#10;&#10;If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4hMJj9ye5BH4bTHEtOBl2w__original/img/1PNatUG-o5uVGISFUe2jFLxcMjU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2554954.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4hMJj9ye5BH4bTHEtOBl2w__thumb/img/I83OtJ1j8z1a4GP3nL3gZGIP-M0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2554954.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/179303","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"25","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.6842","averageWeight":"2.0833","boardGameRank":"2141","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Player Elimination"],"categories":["Card Game","Horror","Humor","Novel-based"],"designers":["Darwin Kastle"]}}
