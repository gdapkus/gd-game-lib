Player options are now expanded into the realm of technological development (to make each civilization more distinctive), and development of Planetary Systems allows for some critical modification of the economic and military lay of the map.&#10;&#10;With the enhanced narrative provided by the addition of Events each Galactic Cycle, social and political considerations are brought into play along with some old-fashioned surprises. Both sides have new Defense Satellite units, plus their own unique ships for both factions including those with Keel Guns, Torpedoes, and Phase Defense Arrays. New Planet markers add spice to the variety of discoveries, and a special Long Game scenario is also included for even more epic-ness!&#10;&#10;There is a great new feel to the game courtesy of the smooth, elegant systems and components included in Imperial Stars II Expansion Kit 1.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3L6DnmBFfYi2GdgSPb0yFA__original/img/EEFVyi1kWxSl6GWQwcerGTlkxfs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2626889.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3L6DnmBFfYi2GdgSPb0yFA__thumb/img/Z3qyAevXpep87g9JxAVefwBNDbM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2626889.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/181895","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
