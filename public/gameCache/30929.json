    "description": "These Age of Steam Expansions are compatible with Winsome's original Age of Steam and Steam. Both maps are tight and highly strategic, with Barbados as a single player map with great replayability, and St. Lucia as a two player map with fast playing time and unique features.\n\nMaps are not mounted.  They are printed on card stock and cut into 2 pieces.\n\n",
