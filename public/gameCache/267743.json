    "type": "boardgameexpansion",
    "description": "After the bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the dust settled from World War II, the nations of the world rebuilt their economies and infrastructure, and the atomic age began. Nations forged alliances through strong diplomacy. They built rockets and satellites and began the space race. They constructed enough nuclear missiles to destroy the world many times over. Their spies were around every corner. The Cold War had begun.\n\nThe Manhattan Project: Energy Empire &ndash; Cold War adds new levels of strategy and options to The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire. The various components in this expansion are divided into separate modules. Players may pick and choose the modules they like best to customize their game, or even choose to eventually add all of the modules to their game. It is recommended that these modules be added to Energy Empire gradually and not all at once.\n\nThe Cold War expansion adds many more opportunities for player interaction, and creates many more varied ways to win. It also adds a Clash of Netions solitaire game.\n\n",
