    "description": "Like Car Wars: The Card Game, Battle Cattle: The Card Game will be a standalone game, with everything you need in one package. And the two games will be completely compatible, allowing you to take your souped-up hot rods out gunning for Bessie... but this time, Bessie shoots back!  Six Cow cards and 112 Moo-ve cards, all full-color, and a rules sheet.\n\n",
