The game is played over three races : a fast race,  a slow race  and &lt;gulp&gt; a brave race . Each player acts simultaneously so there is no downtime between turns. Race order and tadpole tokens mean that you will still have a chance of winning even going into the last race. Points are scored depending on race position  but also for collecting tadpoles. Remember, only frogs that have not had their legs eaten can win the game !&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CpLP33V0HVZzXHJwLrD6dw__original/img/0h4GYkmEiv1aBKfncHuIg2rIayc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic53704.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CpLP33V0HVZzXHJwLrD6dw__thumb/img/TiWHpgejrTcHcfsR9uyVZ7teXZg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic53704.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/13359","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"6.25213","averageWeight":"1.5","boardGameRank":"11352","mechanics":["Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Bluffing","Racing"],"designers":["Gordon Lamont","Fraser Lamont"]}}
