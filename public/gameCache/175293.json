When laying out cards for suggested stops, players need to both match colors and build them in ascending order &mdash; but they also need to bring passengers to this tram line in order to score victory points for it.&#10;&#10;The cards resemble postcards that feature street cars in Munich and historical parts of the city.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3d-sq2Dmx1Xkt6w9rC0MmQ__original/img/nHzktlDPFJkL8_0_d7yXdVkJTTc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2524793.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3d-sq2Dmx1Xkt6w9rC0MmQ__thumb/img/obKY1axgFLxeBPgCRIHO6HVvZ4Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2524793.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/175293","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.94518","averageWeight":"1.798","boardGameRank":"1942","mechanics":["Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Ordering","Score-and-Reset Game","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Trains","Transportation"],"designers":["Helmut Ohley"]}}
