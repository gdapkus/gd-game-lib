They proceed around the board, encountering spaces that cause yields to change; prices to change; players to draw Risk or Option cards or roll on the Fate table; players to buy, sell, or swap investments; etc. The first player to reach the &quot;Gold!&quot; space gets an extra $1,000,000 and the game ends immediately; the wealthiest player at that point is the winner.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules add fluctuating certificate values and bank auctions of certificates. Playing time is a guess.&#10;&#10;The photo on the game cover is of an actual pile of a million pounds sterling worth of gold bullion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sa1zvt1En7OeWzmMC9A_bA__original/img/AS9cuPxiRpsyU6ua07TXR5ld_To=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic15280.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sa1zvt1En7OeWzmMC9A_bA__thumb/img/T5IXcKSn3uuuRhplFhre66BPfJs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic15280.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/4404","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1981","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"5"}}
