In death, Executioners wish to be surrounded by their handiwork, the abundant skulls of Criminals that they undid.\n\nThis 6-card expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the deadly Executioner. Punish your opponents and score big by attaching Executioners to groups of Criminals. Adding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n\nReleased in the June 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.\n\n",
