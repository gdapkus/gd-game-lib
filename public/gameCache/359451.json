Those locations can be highly advantageous, but they require more work and effort, such as constructing branchlets to give you more opportunities to deliver and gain different rewards.&#10;&#10;Much of the content in Great Western Trail: Rails to the North (Second Edition) was included in the original Rails to the North expansion, but it has been reworked and upgraded, with the player boards being dual-layered, a game board extension that features different rail paths, and the medium town tiles being modified. Other elements included in this expansion are new objective cards, a revised building 13a-13b, new solo-mode materials for Sam, and a new breed of orange cows.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Hif5xp81bi9XZVu-qkYkIw__original/img/eNARi3I3k_LEpGCHgmLRSr64Bx8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6767298.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Hif5xp81bi9XZVu-qkYkIw__thumb/img/Yp89lb6Nf3-RveQEPi3VoUpIm-E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6767298.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/359451","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"150","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"150","bestAtCount":"3"}}
