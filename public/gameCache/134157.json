The members of the guilds were rich men, who were appointed to the most influential positions in the community and wielded immense civic power. The chief representative of the Guilds became the Lord Mayor of London, and the leading delegates of the Guilds became his Aldermen. Other members of the Guilds were the burghers of London. The Guilds ran the city and controlled its commerce; each had its own Hall and its own Coat of Arms.  Representatives of the Guilds met at the Guildhall to discuss the great issues of the day.&#10;&#10;In Guilds of London, you place your liverymen in strategic Guilds, building your power base, so that you can achieve the status of Master in many of them. You also have the opportunity to spread your power into the commercially valuable Ulster or Virginia plantations. Control of each Guild provides victory points and additional actions that you can exploit, so that you can control the future development of the city.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T4uNtrQucW_V5SaQW9jA8w__original/img/sWj48wnM9bzz1GnksGgKkQUqdL0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2958283.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T4uNtrQucW_V5SaQW9jA8w__thumb/img/MfCF85O0t4XmvY4nD-sYdu_kzF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2958283.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/134157","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"4"}}
