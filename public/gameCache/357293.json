    "description": "The Kingdom of Gondor has been beset by enemies for centuries. Constantly under the threat of Mordor, the people of Gondor have grown into stalwart defenders of the Free Peoples, and now players can experience the unyielding will of the Gondorians as they arrive in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. These proud warriors stand tall in the face of adversity, which is reflected in their high-risk, high-reward abilities and tendency to be strongest while threat is high.\n\nFor players who enjoy come-from-behind victories and never backing down, they will love the Defenders of Gondor Starter Deck! This expansion comes with a 53-card pre-built deck, giving players the chance to start playing right out of the box.\n\n-description from publisher\n\n",
