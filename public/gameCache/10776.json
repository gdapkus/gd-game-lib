Despite this unifying theme, the period saw an incredible variety of weaponry and tactics.  The battles portrayed in Sword and Shield have been chosen to illustrate this diversity.&quot;&#10;&#10;The four battles included are:&#10;&#10;Stamford Bridge, 1066&#10;Kalaura, 1078&#10;Lake Peipus, 1262&#10;Bannockburn, 1314&#10;&#10;This is a low complexity war game.  The battles are set pieces where there is little room for maneuver before the action begins.  Each battle has a &quot;campaign&quot; option for it where you get a chance to move the pieces into position before starting hostilities.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a13vWSex_yUwj4rAZ2xneg__original/img/oWPEsQEcN9rM7nRADOx-AqRmyW8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic57662.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a13vWSex_yUwj4rAZ2xneg__thumb/img/Wow92HtX2TAv2G1kFaaZlJLiHhY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic57662.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/10776","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1994","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.371","averageWeight":"2.6667","boardGameRank":"17573","mechanics":["Chit-Pull System","Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid"],"categories":["Medieval","Wargame"],"designers":["Robert G.
