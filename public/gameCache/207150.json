When you enter the room, if you give your reminder token (by discarding it permanently), you may immediately choose between seeing a hidden adjacent room, or being pushed into an adjacent room. If you refuse to give your reminder token or if you don&rsquo;t have it anymore, he pushes you into an adjacent room chosen by the first player of the turn (it can be yourself).&#10;&#10;Note: You can&rsquo;t use this room in Madness mode (due to reminder tokens being absent)&#10;&#10;History Note: Originally called Uncle Tom's Hall, but changed Room 25 publisher Matagot (a French company) once they learned of the meaning of &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; in America. &#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomvasel/the-dice-tower-2016-season-12/posts/1665649&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2BFLrtjjhiDsS4bPE-53Xw__original/img/FBG_b826GawlFSD75WnKRtpEh9c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3155157.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2BFLrtjjhiDsS4bPE-53Xw__thumb/img/SoY6wKY-GP5oIkmNJgQxerhfam8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3155157.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/207150","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"6.9427","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Queue","Cooperative Game","Grid Movement","Memory","Player Elimination","Simultaneous Action Selection","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Bluffing","Deduction","Expansion for Base-game","Exploration","Horror","Maze","Negotiation","Science Fiction"],"designers":["François Rouzé"]}}
