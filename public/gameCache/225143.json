This spring, light-wielding thunderstorms roiled the valleys. Now, with summer come early and a glowing moon overhead, the soil is moist and black and delicious mushrooms are peeking up all over the forest. The Foray is on!&#10;&#10;Morels Foray expands Morels with new items, characters, weather, a more dynamic forest, and unique systems enabling 2-4 players. 3p and 4p have slightly augmented decks, start players with a basket and sticks, and introduce &quot;peek cards&quot; placed beside the deck to show what's coming up in the forest (these cards enhance planning depth but are not immediately accessible).&#10;&#10;Each player count also has unique facets. In 3p, players receive an optional (non-card acquisition) bonus action at the end of each turn. In 4p, a marker rotates clockwise to show who is the Priority Player on any given turn. Players select cards from the same forest simultaneously on a Compass, then reveal and resolve proceeding clockwise before resetting the forest and passing the Priority Marker. Deciphering playing styles and motives is helpful because having selected an option that is no longer available when you go to resolve requires adaptation, at a price. This style of simultaneous play keeps a peppy pace with no down time and resembles a 2p Morels hallmark in evaluating what your opponents are likely to do and adjusting for optimal foraging.&#10;&#10;At its heart, Morels Foray varies both the social and tactical texture of Morels. The new cards present fresh decisions and the opportunity for new strategies.  Weather cards (Rainstorm and Forest Fire) can decimate existing forests or spring up new ones, Items (Map, Shiitake Log) grant power with proper timing, Events (Farmers Market, Eureka!) enable big plays, Characters (Thief, Farm Girl, Eccentric, Chef, Morchella) allow you to interact with the forest and your opponent(s) in new ways, and new mushrooms (Lion's Mane, Panther Cap) expand your foraging options in the ever beckoning forest.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zS7CWn8WG6a8N9CHUfRvCQ__original/img/X-rShggcmY-8wBwHIifzZSCe0S4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3506049.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zS7CWn8WG6a8N9CHUfRvCQ__thumb/img/atd7bd1PMuntQvPTpOVZS3UnSw4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3506049.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/225143","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.09768","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Brent Povis"]}}
