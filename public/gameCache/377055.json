When renowned historian Alejandro Vela discovers one of these secrets&mdash;the ruins of an ancient and forgotten Aztec city&mdash;it sets into motion a plot that could unravel the very fabric of time itself.&#10;&#10;In The Forgotten Age Campaign Expansion, one to four investigators join an expedition to explore these ruins, venturing deep into perilous rainforests and forbidden caverns. Will they survive this dangerous journey, or will it be their undoing?&#10;&#10;This expansion combines all of the campaign and scenario content from the original The Forgotten Age cycle, which was the third cycle of expansions for Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Players only need a copy of the Arkham Horror: The Card Game Revised Core Set to dive into the story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lVVYsrIKeEtIR2RW87ZvQw__original/img/6nEYiLxpUWdiPmn5iUMSRQ87BX0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7360944.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lVVYsrIKeEtIR2RW87ZvQw__thumb/img/vSimt27S71Z82mh8hjyLyGQ2NWI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7360944.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/377055","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"8.63669","averageWeight":"4.5","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":[]}}
