It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aO1Yr8UG_2EsWh3s2WoF4g__original/img/UX6fkyg90dLUn0OY5GjTt1ejdfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2888783.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aO1Yr8UG_2EsWh3s2WoF4g__thumb/img/prJQcEQh1ytDT5UVLiilzqWdr8M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2888783.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/437","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1991","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.27951","averageWeight":"1.775","boardGameRank":"3480","mechanics":["Map Deformation","Modular Board","Point to Point Movement"],"categories":["Children's Game","Fantasy","Maze","Puzzle"],"designers":["Max J.
