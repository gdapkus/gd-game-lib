    "description": "From the manufacturer:  Cranium Family Fun gives families the best way to play together as a team in an unforgettably fun game that gives everyone a chance to shine. Packed with 16 hilarious activities, Cranium Family Fun gets you building, flipping, sketching, sculpting, guessing, and laughing out loud together every time you play!\n\nFrom the back of the box:\nCranium Family Fun features a variety of hilarious activities that will have everyone laughing, high-fiving, and working and playing together! With colorful Cranium Cubes and fun Flipper Frogs, The Family Fun Game delivers the ultimate family game night!\n\nCan Mom flip a frog through a hoop you've sculpted out of clay? Can you pass the Cranium Cubes to Dad ... without using your hands? Can you work together to write down three of the top five most popular pizza toppings?\n\nIn Cranium Family Fun, everyone will have a chance to shine as you perform wacky stunts, act, sketch, guess, sculpt with Cranium Clay, and more! And the short play time (about 40 minutes) makes it easy to squeeze in some laugh-out-loud family fun before dinner or after school.\n\nObject: Be the first team to cross the finish line and you win the game!  The teams score points and move on the board by successfully completing their activities.\n\nHow to play:\n\n1. Divide players into at least two teams. Instruct each team to choose its game piece and place it on the Planet Cranium starting space.\n\n2 Provide each team with paper and a pencil. Place the four card character boxes out on the board (Creative Cat, Star Performer, Word Worm, Date Head). Place the timer, the die and the Cranium Clay container on the table.\n\n3 The first team must choose its character box and draw a card. Follow instructions on the card. The player whose birthday is closest is the first player to go on the team.\n\n4 Roll the die and move the appropriate number of spaces only if your team has completed the character card activity successfully; otherwise, pass the play to the team on the left. Stop on any Planet Cranium spaces you pass over during your move forward. Advance forward to the next Planet Cranium if you roll purple.\n\n5 Advance to the inner fast track if you successfully complete the task from the Planet Cranium card. Remain on the outer scenic track if you do not complete the task.\n\n6 Pass the play to the team on the left after you have advanced your playing piece.\n\n7 Halt the game when a Club Cranium card is drawn. All teams follow the instructions on the card to compete simultaneously against each other in a bonus round. The winning team receives a bonus roll.\n\n8 The winning team rolls and moves. Continue play with the team whose turn it was before the bonus round.\n\n9 Enter the Cranium Central at the end of the game board. When you roll, advance to the appropriate character box as indicated by the color rolled on the die.\n\n10 Complete the activity in Cranium Central. Advance to the next character in clockwise motion. Wait for your next turn to complete that activity.\n\n11 A team wins when it is the first to complete the four activities in Cranium Central.\n\n",
