First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game.&#10;&#10;Second, every route &mdash; whether double or single &mdash; has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll &mdash; which costs 1-4 coins &mdash; to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often.&#10;&#10;These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_wmNjg9ltVqJb1eTuSldow__original/img/NSgv9aIknQYbMVJWSVxdrKqWG5o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1777274.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_wmNjg9ltVqJb1eTuSldow__thumb/img/Gc0FflIjl0jSJw6AOVC74UH6yjw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1777274.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/147938","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"7.35562","averageWeight":"2.1294","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Network and Route Building","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Trains"],"designers":["Alan R.
