The game last three rounds, with players scoring points at the end of each round.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players reveal a communal task card, which is added to any other task cards in play. If a player creates the shapes depicted or create colored groups of the appropriate size, she'll gain or lose points as shown on the task card(s). Each player then randomly determines a different starting tile for the round and places it on her board. Then the building cards are revealed one at a time, and all players take the tile shown and add it to their board by placing it in the top row of their row, then letting it slide down into place among the other tiles. This continues until all tiles have been placed.&#10;&#10;Players then score (or lose) points for the round, and the player with the highest score after three rounds wins! Players can complete an optional fourth round, if desired, and the rules also contain scoring targets for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N9pRlyrC7rhGe0Wfw4KNDA__original/img/X2rYto6IB7oYlQM9YnIgJ_G3bdk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1322248.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N9pRlyrC7rhGe0Wfw4KNDA__thumb/img/Rkiu_P-LJ-cvXa_NmGqZnbgGkv8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1322248.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/89668","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
