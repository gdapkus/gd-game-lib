The survivors have scattered across Mesoamerica, many settling in and around Teotihuacan. The rapid infusion results in accelerated growth of Teotihuacan and leads to the adoption of new technologies as Teotihuacan establishes itself as a seat of power in the region.&#10;&#10;Teotihuacan: Shadow of Xitle adds ten new technologies and ten new starting tiles to the game.&#10;&#10;New technologies enhance advanced strategies and add incredible variety to the game experience by doubling the number of possible technologies.
