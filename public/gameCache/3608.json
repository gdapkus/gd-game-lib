A reference card contains all the relevant maneuverability, speed, and weaponry data. Each plane operates with a log sheet to record moves, ammo, damage, altitude, speed and attitude. All movement is pre-plotted and then executed on the board simultaneously. Hits are determined based on relative facing, range and gunnery strength, and are rolled for on a CRT. Damage can be inflicted on any of a plane's various sections (wing, fuselage, engine, etc).&#10;&#10;Rules are also included for air-to-ground combat. Victory conditions are set by each scenario. &#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqN61oZraeBRsPNnQmtkTw__original/img/jkUbaP4ZTDGqZjDsbPvSMQk3PN4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3638357.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqN61oZraeBRsPNnQmtkTw__thumb/img/dwBZzN_ZNpmlYttrRv17M0kt2jo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3638357.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3608","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1976","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.50228","averageWeight":"3.2523","boardGameRank":"5237","mechanics":["Action Queue","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Movement Points","Paper-and-Pencil","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Simulation","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Aviation / Flight","Wargame","World War II"],"designers":["S.
