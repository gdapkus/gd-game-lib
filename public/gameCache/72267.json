Designed by Rick Holzgrafe, this expansion map uses the score track, pieces, tiles, money, trains, bonds and rules of the original game, but comes with a new map, featuring the Western half of the United States. The basic mechanics and gameplay of the original game are unchanged, as players build track and deliver goods to increase their income and earn points, but the expansion also includes new pieces and rules. These extras may optionally be used with this expansion as well as with the base game and all other expansions.&#10;&#10;This expansion is also compatible with Railroad Tycoon.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L6Kbm1238QqXVXRE3cmAdg__original/img/ieTq76KUhZDULLvQDukPu6hAt_8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic811986.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L6Kbm1238QqXVXRE3cmAdg__thumb/img/hrvAkr1XYW--_ie0wT_iW-A_WBM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic811986.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/72267","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"5"}}
