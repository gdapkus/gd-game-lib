This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Dampfross&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7CGV9Of3kmucTTApmcgb3w__original/img/N1cARCmWqLJ6wcBjmoYx4jlPQdE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic195636.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7CGV9Of3kmucTTApmcgb3w__thumb/img/FmdHzMPElkYzfh2BvxVtTr2Kzfk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic195636.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/460","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1979","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"3"}}
