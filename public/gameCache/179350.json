If they score immediately, they have guaranteed themselves some points; if they wait, they could reach higher scores or send workers to harbors to earn extra bonuses for the remaining rounds.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gExc_oImkfs1GwMrsa1VtA__original/img/GgYlE8GGvz0RxeyyE0kA8cP3XmI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2578047.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gExc_oImkfs1GwMrsa1VtA__thumb/img/0Q2U8x26rhVz9_LN445pmJGswSk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2578047.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/179350","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
