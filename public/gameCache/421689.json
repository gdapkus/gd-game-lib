New heroes, better prepared than their predecessors, gather to face the prospect of a mechanical monster, but the changing landscape brings greater uncertainty as they explore Tunguska with fresh eyes.&#10;&#10;The Gears of Corruption expansion to Expeditions adds elements of risk and danger in the form of secret bonuses on map tokens and a corrupted mech that roams the land. To counter these threats, the expansion offers 2 new mechs and 4 new character/companion pairs, as well as components for a 6th player. Gears of Corruption also accelerates early gameplay by giving players starting resources and a hero worker that can act as any type of worker.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O3DXJ_f_IKJZblCpPcEPgw__original/img/Ca0Bo8ipgSvaFPI6v9jXWDTuSh0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8221886.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O3DXJ_f_IKJZblCpPcEPgw__thumb/img/OQeU2p15ZyfCeDKXc2aUgOaQ8jU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8221886.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/421689","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2024","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"8.47923","averageWeight":"3.1667","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Jamey Stegmaier"]}}
