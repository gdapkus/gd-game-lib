Put it at the bottom of the shuffled stack instead. Harlekin will always be one of the last two cards from which you can choose one to play for both actions.&#10;&#10;His first ability clears all remaining buildings in a row on the central board.&#10;&#10;His second ability gives you 3 of a certain resource, determined by rolling a die.&#10;&#10;This expansion, originally available as a promotional item in Spielbox 2015/7, appears in the Glass Road base game starting with the 2021 editions.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DfMZP-KaTBiHAYQdES0I-Q__original/img/z7dNnzr02ueIfFlVWBSGiPPLjIQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2896517.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DfMZP-KaTBiHAYQdES0I-Q__thumb/img/ohgkPbJusNP9LdZ2C67bomQ0LOE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2896517.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/190602","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"1"}}
