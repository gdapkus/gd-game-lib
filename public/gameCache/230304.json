    "description": "The Nautilus&rsquo; Traps brings you to the bottom of the sea. When a sea monster attacks your submarine at the outset of the adventure, it's up to you to make your way through the depths and back to the surface if you're going to escape&hellip;before your oxygen runs out.\n\nUnlock! is a series of escape adventures for up to six players. With one hour on the clock, players work through a deck of sixty cards as a team, searching for clues, combining objects, and solving puzzles. The free Unlock! companion app runs the timer while also providing clues, offering hints, and confirming successes. Once the team has reached a solution and entered the correct code into the app, they will escape and win the game!\n\n",
