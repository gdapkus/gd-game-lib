Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames &mdash; single-word labels like &quot;disease&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, and &quot;carrot&quot;. Yes, carrot. It's a legitimate codename. Each spymaster wants their team to identify their agents first...without uncovering the assassin by mistake.&#10;&#10;In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Lay out 25 cards, each bearing a single word. The spymasters look at a card showing the identity of each card, then take turns clueing their teammates. A clue consists of a single word and a number, with the number suggesting how many cards in play have some association to the given clue word. The teammates then identify one agent they think is on their team; if they're correct, they can keep guessing up to the stated number of times; if the agent belongs to the opposing team or is an innocent bystander, the team's turn ends; and if they fingered the assassin, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Spymasters continue giving clues until one team has identified all of their agents or the assassin has removed one team from play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F_KDEu0GjdClml8N7c8Imw__original/img/gcX_EfjsRpB5fI4Ug4XV73G4jGI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2582929.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F_KDEu0GjdClml8N7c8Imw__thumb/img/yl8iXxSNwguMeg3KkmfFO9SMVVc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2582929.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/178900","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[6,8],"averageRating":"7.53764","averageWeight":"1.2611","boardGameRank":"146","mechanics":["Communication Limits","Memory","Push Your Luck","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Card Game","Deduction","Party Game","Spies / Secret Agents","Word Game"],"designers":["Vlaada Chv√°til"]}}
