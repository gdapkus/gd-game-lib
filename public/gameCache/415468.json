    "description": "As dark threats loom over Middle-earth, ever more people are torn from their homes and left without safety or refuge. What begins as a simple task of escorting a band of such wanderers to a new home quickly evolves into something drastically more perilous when a mighty threat emerges from the wilds of Rhovanion.&#10;&#10;In the Ered Mithrin Campaign Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, one to four players explore the Wilderlands of Middle-earth in their quest to defeat a dragon that is terrorizing the countryside. Over the course of nine scenarios&mdash;which can be played standalone or as part of a larger campaign&mdash;the heroes must battle Goblins, explore the vast Wilderland, and steel themselves for a showdown with the dragon itself!&#10;&#10;This expansion includes all of the scenarios originally featured in The Wilds of Rhovanion and the Ered Mithrin cycle, now repackaged into one box along with all-new campaign content.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
