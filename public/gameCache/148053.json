When drawing stones from the bag, if you draw a weed, place it with the pile of rocks that you're currently assembling for bid. If you win a weed along with rocks, you wait for everyone to place their rocks in their gardens, then you place the weed in another player's garden. During scoring, you receive one demerit card for each weed in your garden.&#10;&#10;If you place a rock in a garden where a weed is located, you remove the weed in place of the rock. Alternatively, if you pass during bidding, you can remove all of the weeds in your garden. In either case, removed weeds are placed into the bag once again. You just can't get rid of them forever!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UUZn-ovf77QC5vJccsd4Pg__original/img/EzkmygMUpfXLNNvp77dWD8TWi-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1778789.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UUZn-ovf77QC5vJccsd4Pg__thumb/img/Zst8mwHJKiPERubosUaI7Hf98C8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1778789.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148053","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"50","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":"3"}}
