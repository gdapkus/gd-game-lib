Messages need to be delivered and privileges obtained. Of course, none of this can be accomplished on one's own. Much negotiation and deal-making is the order of the day in an effort to become the richest deal-maker in Genoa.  Flexible rules allow for negotiating almost everything in the game.&#10;&#10;The Traders of Genoa version of this game is #6 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qvdaFRXlvJ2e0Qzppl-QTg__original/img/ygHyecf3NtVjZYDEKpr9ABYpD5s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic450409.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qvdaFRXlvJ2e0Qzppl-QTg__thumb/img/6rmlx_FNiI_sxM82CNCpADlP2EQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic450409.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1345","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2001","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"5"}}
