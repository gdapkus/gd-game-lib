    "description": "Battling Tops was produced by Ideal, in the late 60's. Players wind their tops and by pulling a string, the tops battle each other in a ring. The last top standing wins that round. The first \"manager\" to reach 8 wins is the champion.\n\nBattling Ships (1977) was an updated release with a \"board\" around the battling arena that's kind of like the edges of Monopoly. Otherwise it is the same as Battling Tops.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Spin to Win Game\n    Battling Gladiators\n\n\n",
