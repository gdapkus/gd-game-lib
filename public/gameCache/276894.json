On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gJq8JOmOmmZSFpbrWGQMDQ__original/img/nrik6K05TtQl7RSfCD-syaOnBoU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4666620.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gJq8JOmOmmZSFpbrWGQMDQ__thumb/img/kjppa8fi_pMWlWpMVfC6xAMgec8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4666620.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/276894","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.07984","averageWeight":"1.3365","boardGameRank":"1067","mechanics":["Hand Management","Network and Route Building","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Trains"],"designers":["Alan R.
