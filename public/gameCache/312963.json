It's the original extra content that was created during the KS-campaign (and given for free to KS-backers) and will be available afterwards.&#10;&#10;You add as much monuments as there are players at the start of the game. If you can create the exact shape of a monument with free squares on your board, you can claim the corresponding monument tile, which will be worth 5 VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/guSxkuPAjkdpsO2ePrmAyw__original/img/YZM4rPHbFqlWpk5-iYkdEwFRqe0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5516809.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/guSxkuPAjkdpsO2ePrmAyw__thumb/img/-Vz_cOS4nzhUBOh2Z03Hba-UIM4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5516809.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/312963","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"6.80647","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Pattern Building","Simultaneous Action Selection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Science Fiction","Space Exploration"],"designers":["Scott Almes"]}}
