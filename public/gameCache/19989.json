For the wealth of the big towns and the villages belonging to them is just too tempting.&#10;&#10;Of course, once in possession, no knight wants to lose his newly acquired properties, so this means: caution. For the other players&acute;knights are awake to any opportunity and the newly gained land may be lost again just as quickly to a new lord.&#10;&#10;Bring your landscape tiles and above all your knights skilfully into play, secure your properties on all sides and watch out for enemy knights at all time.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7JcR-BemuD9hNvHXdPptZw__original/img/vt4SAcGZv81QSINKBtGLhCFH0zE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic159125.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7JcR-BemuD9hNvHXdPptZw__thumb/img/tbST4rRef0WbhS7StyViv1a_ppU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic159125.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/19989","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
