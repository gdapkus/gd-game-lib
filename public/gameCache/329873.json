    "description": "Grove is the citrusy sequel to the award winning Orchard 9 card solitaire game. &#10;Its 18 cards feature orange, lemon and lime trees and a new 'wild card' element, glades. These open spaces without trees, combined with a new scoring mechanic, offer more ways and opportunities to increase your harvest and create a greater variety of gameplay and strategies compared to Orchard.&#10;You'll also find a cheeky squirrrel, who can either help or hinder your fruit picking, as well as a wheelbarrow - useful if you manage to get an extra large haul.&#10;&#10;The card backs feature recipe challenges with various scoring conditions and target scores. These provide a win/lose condition (as an alternative to the standard game's &lsquo;beat your score&rsquo;) for those that prefer it - and add even more variety to the game.&#10;&#10;",
