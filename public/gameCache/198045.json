Whether you use one deck, or all of them, you&rsquo;ll find they increase the challenge and drama of your Elder Sign adventure. Even more, they&rsquo;ll immerse you more deeply into its world and help you connect more fully to the investigator that you're playing.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4q08G_Y1YqyOtekExROWHQ__original/img/D-YJLbu_R0WrzjknM61jD4sKxzk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2993882.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4q08G_Y1YqyOtekExROWHQ__thumb/img/E3WloYy27wn_l-FhEuGAvCRDPmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2993882.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/198045","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.34786","averageWeight":"2.6667","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Card Game","Dice","Fantasy","Fighting","Horror","Novel-based"],"designers":["Molly Glover","Richard Launius"]}}
