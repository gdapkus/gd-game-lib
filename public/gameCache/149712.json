If he rolls three of the same number (i.e. the same number on all three dice), he receives two Orange God tiles. If a player rolls two or more of the same number but there are no Orange God tiles left in the general supply, he doesn't receive anything.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player places a die on an action card, he can use the Orange God tiles to turn his die 1 number up or down. The tiles then go back into the general supply. Note: the die number must be changed before the die is placed onto an action card. One die number can be changed per Orange God tile used. Also note, a die showing the number 1 cannot be turned down to a 6, and a die showing the number 6 cannot be turned up to a 1.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BCzkgal5jd0PRjZAL9tr2g__original/img/lZkyf8rXYk4ccwVNUxHD5lVDeyw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1828429.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BCzkgal5jd0PRjZAL9tr2g__thumb/img/rBLp5MV2hFG8T4DFaLuyTInNj9U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1828429.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149712","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
