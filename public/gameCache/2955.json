Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.&#10;&#10;Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.&#10;&#10;Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.&#10;&#10;In the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.&#10;&#10;Only districts are scored in the first scoring round.&#10;&#10;In the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Mexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bOJ-MJseZ4R9SPx-NDrQw__original/img/sH9IcE1o34bIspTeSE_-NSdYdZc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2470537.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bOJ-MJseZ4R9SPx-NDrQw__thumb/img/0KYcQBPLgzdLE2UqKjs-6yCtlZg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2470537.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2955","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"4"}}
