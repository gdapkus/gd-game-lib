There are 12 constellations and players use &quot;Stars&quot; to bid for the control. Each star is worth some amount of control over the constellation, and there is a &quot;Double&quot; star and a &quot;Black Hole&quot; star thrown into the mix. There is some aspect of bluff in the game since some of your stars may be placed face up or down.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M3a9VcD0tgWSXiKMVKWsKw__original/img/hwJh_Ai_O6ZPmzS9GcjHhpUafsY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3837475.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M3a9VcD0tgWSXiKMVKWsKw__thumb/img/h1bBBZ5z8OmUGaSe_21DTZlb1vE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3837475.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/668","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"1995","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
