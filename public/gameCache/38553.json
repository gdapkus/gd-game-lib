It is a game about recognizing routes, and developing profitable infrastructures; but above all, it's a game of racing your opponent to that one great opportunity you both see-- or do they have a different plan?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to amass riches by buying plastic beads, yellow rubber ducks, blue paint, and other innovative high-tech materials and then selling them to hapless consumers across the universe.&#10;&#10;Players take turns. Most turns will be very quick as players focus on collecting enough energy to realize their plans. From time to time, a player will burst into action, fly around the universe, and, hopefully, gain more money than his opponents&hellip;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players improve their spaceship, adding extra gear and cargo space.
