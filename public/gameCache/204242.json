You'll score points for this goon based on certain conditions, but if someone ever controls more territory of this color than you, that player takes control of the boss and you have to say goodbye to those goons.&#10;&#10;Goons of New York was made in conjunction with the Brooklyn Game Lab, an afterschool program in which children learn to play today's best board games, then discuss the strategies and tactics used to play them. For this project, hundreds of children worked together &mdash; in a month-long game-jam &mdash; to design and playtest this promotional content for New York 1901, which is currently planned to be made available solely at trade shows and game conventions.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zh5l-K0kX4v7aZfFZZ4yHw__original/img/BukDvoyNhIYEntvvhplSMCVF0GY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3100071.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zh5l-K0kX4v7aZfFZZ4yHw__thumb/img/YBgaiXYtHKjV_RfVc4jry4hLApE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3100071.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/204242","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.04214","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Brooklyn Game Lab"]}}
