If you play a card of the next season, the season changes!&#10;&#10;A change in season often alters who wins that trick, as the highest rank card of the season that the trick ends in, wins that trick. These potential mid-trick season changes means that standard trick-taking maneuvers, such as drawing out trump, often won't work.&#10;&#10;Players score points either by taking the 6 Holly and Oak kings, worth 1 or 2 points each, or by taking no tricks at all, worth 8, 5, or 3 points in 3, 4, and 5 player games respectively.&#10;&#10;Between no-trick scoring and mid-trick trump changes, Holly Oak becomes a game of manipulating both the lead and current season to your advantage. Can you master the changing seasons?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hr8DKkQYROjlPVJA3-05jg__original/img/qiwgeRxaz9kTgn74pxn7XbjONLo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7754487.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hr8DKkQYROjlPVJA3-05jg__thumb/img/eL-onbbKGCl8s19ftn2VCLraBpE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7754487.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/389513","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"3"}}
