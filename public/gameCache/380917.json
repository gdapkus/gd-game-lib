    "description": "Concordia: Roma/Sicilia is an expansion for Concordia that provides a double-sided game board for two different experiences:&#10;&#10;&#10;     In Roma, you build the eternal city with famous places like the Colosseum, Forum Romanum, Circus Maximus, or Pantheon. Send your colonist ships abroad to gather extra benefits.&#10;     On the island of Sicilia, coincidental eruptions of the volcano Etna may hit you. It's a new element of luck, but Sicilia can be played without that option as well.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",
