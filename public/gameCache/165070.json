You have traded paint at the Velodrome. Verghn&rsquo;s Grove is old hat. It&rsquo;s time to become a full-season driver and step up to new challenges, including the very narrow short track, the sweeping turns of the quad-oval, or the fast mile.  More road courses are included as well to test your mettle in more directions than left.&#10;&#10;Thunder Alley now has a track pack. Four new tracks all peppered with new challenges. Some provide tighter racing and others allow for more wide open affairs. It&rsquo;s all different and it&rsquo;s all new. With these four additional tracks players can recreate full seasons of racing for stock cars or open wheels.&#10;&#10;All tracks are compatible with both Thunder Alley and Grand Prix.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZW2WGPuHZzU7y95tdUXUTg__original/img/SCvzEZsSYGjwP1x3Ncy8rxJTZV8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2632880.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZW2WGPuHZzU7y95tdUXUTg__thumb/img/549lWy7iFg5Qx76TmitpuHz5QlU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2632880.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/165070","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"8.01832","averageWeight":"1.5","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Racing","Sports"],"designers":["Carla Horger","Jeff Horger"]}}
