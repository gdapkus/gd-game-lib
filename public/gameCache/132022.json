The three cards are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     An aerial scene depicting a knight on a purple dragon, a cowboy  on a giant eagle, and a gypsy on a flying carpet.  You might recognize this illustration, as it was used as the box cover of Dixit 3!&#10;     An image of earth with a halo of fire (or maybe smoke or something else?) surrounding it.  There is also a giant hand palm-side up beneath the earth.&#10;     A forest scene, where a harp is built into one of the trees and plays a song.  Someone has also carved a heart into one of the trees and shot it with an arrow.&#10;&#10;&#10;These cards are new and not available in the USA (other than being the cover image on the Dixit 3 box!)!  The set will be made available in the BoardGameGeek Geek Store beginning in October or November of 2012. These cards are regular part of a european edition of Dixit 3.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DLq-W5cSL_y1u-R40Nx1Rw__original/img/W8e_nYSSqZmVrWmCvjaQTwpYmBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1444305.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DLq-W5cSL_y1u-R40Nx1Rw__thumb/img/bAlz1OrhSeN0SKQ975K6J_649r8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1444305.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/132022","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[5,6],"averageRating":"7.4398","averageWeight":"1.2222","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Simultaneous Action Selection","Storytelling","Voting"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction","Humor","Party Game"],"designers":["Jean-Louis Roubira"]}}
