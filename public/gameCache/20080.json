Therefore, not all water pipes can be completed.&#10;&#10;Plan ahead such that your workers build the longest aqueducts to earn the most fame at the end.&#10;&#10;Aqua Romana is a tile laying game for 2 to 4 players. During his turn a player can extend an aqueduct, close an aqueduct and earn points for closed aqueducts.&#10;&#10;To extend an aqueduct, the player chooses a worker and the corresponding architect, play the corresponding tile, move the workers forward and move the architect ahead.&#10;&#10;An aqueduct is closed when it ends at the side of the gameboard or a non-fitting neighboring tile.&#10;&#10;A closed aqueduct yields 1 point for every tile it is long. If an aqueduct crosses a tile for the second time, it yields two points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no tile can be played for an entire round. Winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uqZ_Kf6mlRJFSkEqCCCDtg__original/img/gaZCXjtNqsJBBWiSlYIeEm33SyI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic485685.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uqZ_Kf6mlRJFSkEqCCCDtg__thumb/img/mPSt_lfxD_v3fjalAQEq0vlFUiE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic485685.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/20080","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
