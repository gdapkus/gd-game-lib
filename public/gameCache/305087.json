    "description": "\"Backers expressed a desire to see an 'easy villain to learn on/play with kids' and we included a matching stunt to help ease the difficulty. Since not everyone plays this way, we didn't feel like it made sense to included as a standard component of the game. That is why it is a Kickstarter exclusive that YOU can choose.\n\n\"If you thought Nick & Ginger were bad, meet the Mother of the Mother of Mouth Disease! A truly Gross Great-Granny, Ruth Canal is an aged antihero who still manages a bit of elderly evildoing. Good for kids and learning, Ruth might be a bit long in the tooth to put up a real ruckus, but rest assured her grandson, Nick, is ready to mistreat your mandible for making his grandma such an easy mark.\n\n\"Double the pleasure, double the fun! Double Mint is the promo stunt that you need to succeed!\"\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
