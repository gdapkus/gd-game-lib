Instead it had promotional information for the Cities of Splendor expansion.&#10;&#10;It is a noble that requires 4 blue and 4 red to claim for 3 points.&#10;&#10;Works like any other noble and is just mixed into any game of Splendor that includes nobles. Cannot be used with the &quot;Cities of Splendor&quot; module from the Cities of Splendor expansion.&#10;&#10;Another version was available during the Game Boy Geek 2017 Kickstarter campaign that was the same as the one from the Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017 aside from different artwork. The Game Boy Geek promo was later available again during the 2021 Kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R4XgaeYp0oOzPBJ3Oy32OQ__original/img/ztWEvevWOZx4yj8viFHtHvqb3w4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4392258.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R4XgaeYp0oOzPBJ3Oy32OQ__thumb/img/vis7EDE5TMU_Nw8sVrWUGZDfxug=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4392258.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/234162","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
