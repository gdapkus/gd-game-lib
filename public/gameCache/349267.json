    "description": "Faith, like hope, springs eternal. Zealots served their mission well in life. Now they must be rewarded with proximity to other practitioners. \n\nIt will come as no surprise that Zealots interact with Priests. Each Zealot will score points for Priests that are either above or below them in the stack. Check each Zealot individually, choosing whether to score above or below, and then count the Priests in that direction. Devoting yourself to Zealots can be a huge boon to your score, as long as you can keep the faith.\n\n\nZealots is a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.\n\nThis expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: the Zealots. Zealots want to have many Priests above or below them.\n\nAdding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play.\n\n",
