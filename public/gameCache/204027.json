Whenever no unplanted box is visible on a bed, you have completed it, then you count your points and replace it with a fresh, unplanted bed. You gain points for all of the visible plant pots and planting bells.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players select various polyomino tiles of flower beds from a central market grid, depending on the location of the &quot;gardener&quot;, then place them on one of their two personal garden boards. Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished. Crossing over a line on each track awards bonus tokens that can fill in empty spaces or give you a better selection of the flower bed tiles. Whenever a garden is finished, you receive a new one to complete. After the gardener completes her fifth lap around the market, the game enters its last round. The player with the most points from their completed gardens at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Cottage Garden is the first part of Uwe Rosenberg&#039;s puzzle trilogy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Zk5_GsYycmHYD4RN3kIJQ__original/img/LbvQO9zKGNFn9UKo_adUsarRarQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499059.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Zk5_GsYycmHYD4RN3kIJQ__thumb/img/feLpplY6_MLKO4Tzfj5N2bW4a9o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499059.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/204027","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
