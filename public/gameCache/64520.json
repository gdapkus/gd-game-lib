    "description": "Gongor Whist is a solitaire trick-taking game in which you try to win tricks against a dummy hand.\nThe trump is randomly determined by flipping over an Ace, but with every trick you have the option of randomly determining a new trump.\n\nEach pass through the deck is two hands; each hand uses about half the cards.\n\nThe goal is to successfully make all the possible bids without repeating any of them.\n\n\n     Rules at the Decktet Wiki\n\n\n",
