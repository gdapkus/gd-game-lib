    "description": "Shell Shock! is a two-player game of combat, adventure and heroism in World War II Europe; adapted from the award-winning and incredibly popular Ambush! solitaire game. In each of six missions, one player commands a squad of German infantry while another commands American, British, or Soviet troops. The players determine the composition of their squads - men, weapons, and equipment - and purchase Light and Heavy supports to assist them in the mission - from foxholes and barbed wire to artillery support. Every playing is different as the intensity of the battle, mission objectives, forces and weather change.\n\nContents:\nOne 22\" x 32\" Map Display with one 16\" x 18 \" Map\nFour 8\" x 16\" Maps (B-E)\n540 Counters (3 Sheets total)\nOne Rule Booklet\nTwo Mission Booklets\nTwo Player Cards \nTwo Squad Record Pads\nTwo Vehicle Displays\n120 Playing Cards\n- 46 Random Event\n- 30 Allied Aid Card\n- 30 German Aid Card\n- 8 Special Guest\n- 6 Crew Vehicle\nOne Counter Tray\nTwo ten-sided dice\n\n",
