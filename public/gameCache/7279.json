    "description": "A game of fast action and hilarious fun.  Players race to complete their puzzle first.  Face the challenge!  All pieces are mixed and divided evenly.  Players strategically trade for the pieces they need as they assemble their puzzles behind a partition.\n\nA great game for all seasons!\n\n\nGame Summary\n- Use 1 puzzle and matching photo per player, returning the unused one(s) to the box.\n- Take apart all puzzles, shuffle the pieces, and divide evenly amongst players\n- Shuffle the photos and deal randomly to each player, who will mount it on the inside of their screen.\n- Players play simultaneously, trying to assemble their puzzle.\n- Exchanges\n... At any time, a player may select a set of 1-3 pieces and offer to trade them; must exchange those pieces with the first player to accept the offer (trade for an equal number of pieces)\n... Up to 3 times/game, a player may force everyone to trade 1-3 pieces to left/right/across (no 'across' in a 3er, of course!)\n... The 'Advanced' Rule: once each (I think), players may force a shuffling and redistribution of the puzzle photos! I must admit that we didn't try this -- it just seems ridiculously chaotic and random.\n- The first player to complete their puzzle wins!",
