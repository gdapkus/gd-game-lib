Its market has become one of the most popular on the coast, and merchants are fighting to be able to install their stalls. Competition is tough to make a fortune, especially since the customer is demanding. This requires having well-stocked stalls to attract the wealthy customers and increase its reputation. But be careful not to incur the wrath of the consul as this could cost you. However, you can always count on the gods and goddesses to give you a boost, with, of course, some offerings. And yes, everything is paid in this world ...&#10;&#10;In Massilia, each player will be able to use different colored dice to perform actions. There are four different colors corresponding to four different actions. On his turn, a player can choose a die and perform the corresponding action: Buy goods at the port, move a client or the consul on the market, make offerings to divinities to recover bonuses (cards), and buy reputation. The value of the die shows the number of times that the action may be made. The goal is to obtain the highest reputation at the end of the day by setting up stalls on the market to sell goods at the best price that the player will have bought in port.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pmAiFH8yjgQ6J__DdNu6pg__original/img/hoIRoXd3HW70Cl9VubioSokuNkQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2206782.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pmAiFH8yjgQ6J__DdNu6pg__thumb/img/0QqUU2u2WF2UY781Ljd2pGkB4J4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2206782.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/119622","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
