If an existing cloud is moved onto the Lake via a Wind card action, the player performing the Wind action must immediately add 3 of their own drops into the cloud - signifying the water the breeze evaporates from the Lake&rsquo;s surface. If a cloud is moved off from the Lake tile via a Wind card action, it can be moved any number of times (even changing directions). The cloud must stop moving if merged with another cloud, and cannot re-enter the Lake during the same Wind card action it left it.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ga-T-421ytCMCrgA6huN9w__original/img/IluRsYkWHB_cprxy46Mbk5zj-vs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4026369.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ga-T-421ytCMCrgA6huN9w__thumb/img/on3AUpt9vKh9D1ztHRa_uC-9qrc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4026369.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/317579","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":null}}
