Our galaxy is protected by the Guardians of the Galaxy, and when Earth's Alpha Flight Station comes under attack by the Badoon, only the Guardians stand a chance of stopping the attack and uncovering the true motives behind it...&#10;&#10;The Galaxy's Most Wanted campaign expansion adds over 250 new cards to Marvel Champions: The Card Game. Rocket Racoon and Groot join the roster of heroes with fully pre-built and ready-to-play player decks stuffed with new cards. Whether they're playing these new heroes or relying on old favorites, players can test their mettle against four brand-new villains: Drang of the Brotherhood of Badoon, the Collector (featured in two separate scenarios), Nebula, and Ronan the Accuser. Each of these five scenarios offers a unique challenge that can be played independently or as part of a larger campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l8mHw41U2cp63RyVfPIYfQ__original/img/KvqBQ1bQW_-Hp6xVb6wzoRAba3M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6077779.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l8mHw41U2cp63RyVfPIYfQ__thumb/img/kc7wWutKyZkwcdZK1bnp6ZeFL6U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6077779.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/315896","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
