You and your fellow Dukes must recruit citizens and buy domains to build up your kingdoms and slay the foul creatures that lurk in the surrounding lands.&#10;&#10;Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a tableau-building game for 1-5 players and will feel familiar to deck-building fans. The cards you buy can work for you on your turn and on all the other player turns, as well. On your turn, roll two dice and activate citizen cards with the result of each individual die and the sum of both dice. Other players will simultaneously activate their citizen cards based on the roll. Next, take two actions from the following: slay a monster, recruit a citizen, buy a domain, or take 1 of any resource. The player with the most victory points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WcC51JYkbf9CYjKGgAVQAw__original/img/HNPdp4xIbg_Sl1u1kcS99blEO60=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6922596.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WcC51JYkbf9CYjKGgAVQAw__thumb/img/Hk5M9-pYZe0XVkXg2FiOaT07EPk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6922596.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/170561","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.44421","averageWeight":"1.9801","boardGameRank":"610","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Open Drafting","Random Production","Variable Set-up"],"categories":["Card Game","Dice","Fantasy"],"designers":["Isaias Vallejo"]}}
