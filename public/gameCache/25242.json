Who hasn't dreamed of riding through the middle of the jungle on the back of an elephant? Plagued by mosquitoes, sweat beading your brow, experiencing the most dangerous adventures and, at the end, to be rewarded by gemstones of incredible value? In this card game - admittedly, with a little imagination - all this is possible. Players play as treasure hunters and, over the course of the game, try to find the most valuable treasures while giving the cursed treasures to their opponents. The player who can call the most valuable treasures his at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;This game is an extended version of Ex und Hopp.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UbdiA2fMEjZQE96aDstgcg__original/img/AG2gkXx6qIsUcI1x5INmZod8UAI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic147376.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UbdiA2fMEjZQE96aDstgcg__thumb/img/EahLk3ZNxBXprXYAFek4_mliq0I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic147376.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/25242","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"3"}}
