It adds new cards to the game and rules for factions and team play. This increases tension in the early stages for four or more players, and 15 additional character cards allows Coup to be better played with up to ten players.&#10;&#10;With Coup: Reformation, each player must declare themself either Loyalist or Reformist (Catholic and Reformist in the first edition) and can target only members of the other faction. Conversion is possible, however, for yourself or for another player by paying a charitable donation to the Treasury (Almshouse). Like all factions, once you have eliminated or converted the other group, you just descend into in-fighting, so there's still only one winner and no second place.&#10;&#10;Coup: Reformation adds a new fluid team dynamic to Coup as players jostle with their allegiance to take advantage or seek protection in the early stages of the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Pnt6sTdrbrGhCH0uPvdSQ__original/img/Yge9TxsRfjTbG2QuXC3kM9vVZjs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1978817.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Pnt6sTdrbrGhCH0uPvdSQ__thumb/img/LLNU6pQ0o1tejgTGDuFstJkJJP0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1978817.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148931","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"10","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"7.2556","averageWeight":"1.5894","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Player Elimination","Take That","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction","Expansion for Base-game","Political"],"designers":["Rikki Tahta"]}}
