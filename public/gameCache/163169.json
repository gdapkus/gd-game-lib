Each expansion can be played by adding cards to the basic game or by mixing them together if you want a completely new and crazy gaming experience.&#10;&#10;This expansion contains a mixture of new game materials, but above all it gives players access to the secrets of air magic, the freshest elemental art. Now careless heroes can twist and storm everything around them to make their situation even more interesting.&#10;&#10;Stormy Winds includes new monsters and equipment, a new sorceress heroine, an ancient greek god as the Boss, and new maps with special rooms. You can accumulate experience points as in a real fantasy game, and power cards allow you to activate devastating air powers, such as the &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; spell, but beware the new monster flying ability! You will fight using the air elemental die and, of course, make new &quot;impossible&quot; die rolls!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XZkjtmDardNLSoKoBLUBfQ__original/img/1Zh8CHlVzWah_Km5SE0AlVMg6YI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2411497.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XZkjtmDardNLSoKoBLUBfQ__thumb/img/kkNy2YSP6duN-akO2yOONNSCx34=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2411497.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/163169","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.50889","averageWeight":"1.8889","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Open Drafting","Point to Point Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Action / Dexterity","Dice","Expansion for Base-game","Exploration","Fantasy","Fighting","Humor"],"designers":["Lorenzo Silva"]}}
