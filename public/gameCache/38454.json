But rather than draw and collect Train cards, they roll five custom Train dice each turn.&#10;&#10;Depending on the outcome they can re-roll some or all, then use the dice to claim routes on the board; grab Route Tokens for future use; or draw more Destination Tickets.&#10;&#10;For board maps that feature Tunnel routes, such as Ticket to Ride: Europe, 3 Tunnel dice are also included.&#10;&#10;This expansion requires trains, Destination Tickets and a board map from any of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SK8y0CtOXpsTrE9rajpjvQ__original/img/Q9DHcPp67ven0DzYIsEhythCE3M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic372893.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SK8y0CtOXpsTrE9rajpjvQ__thumb/img/iq_aoHX6IeOpJ1Kj4ukdy7DS4wE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic372893.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/38454","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":"4"}}
