This game is similar in nature to Elfenroads/Elfenland in that players try to visit as many cities as possible using optimal transportation cards; what's different is that the lay of the land is also dictated by card play.  Other players may interfere with your journey through the use of thieves, obstacles, and sea serpents.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L_ijbDT0eKXZBTB8RGzJJA__original/img/rD3fOt5_BFUQeOu2H9XrKmtiNqo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic369769.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L_ijbDT0eKXZBTB8RGzJJA__thumb/img/6ifi9itZZySwvvDapkL3rpdDmyk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic369769.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/229","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1999","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
