    "description": "The HABITATS XL expansion adds 16 tiles (and 3 game turns per player) :\n\n- 8 animal tiles that need a larger habitat than any of the base game animals, and bring you more victory points if you fulfill their requirements.\n\n- 4 camp site tiles, for your adventurous park visitors to spend the night. You score the victory points if the camp has all the indicated park connections satisfied. The better base it is to walk to different areas of your park, the more points it is worth.\n\n- 4 flower tiles.\n\n",
