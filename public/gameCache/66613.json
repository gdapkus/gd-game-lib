The towers are built by placing the ships next to the towers and paying with different colored shells.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have to decide whether to take cards or place ships by playing those cards; the cards are color-coded to match the ships being placed. The map shows a hex grid with all kind of symbols, showing the reward you get for building and spaces where you can build the towers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rHsStOrV1bLQtMI_KGMn8g__original/img/LP8Wm1NeQJvcX0CQOYvFf0Kx3fY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2691917.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rHsStOrV1bLQtMI_KGMn8g__thumb/img/dY3mzkMUqNsmcUZtWHxjlj12Od8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2691917.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66613","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
