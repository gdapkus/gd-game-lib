Beware the monsters of the sea, though, as they increase in strength, sowing chaos throughout all of Valeria.&#10;&#10;Along the top of the play area is a new game board called &quot;The Islands&quot;. To access the Islands you need to use a new action called &quot;Sail&quot; and to sail, you've got to spend one map token, then you can access Araby to gain Goods, Nae Aerie to gain Tomes, Exekratys to retrieve lost resources, and Amarynth to rescue captured Noble's.&#10;&#10;This expansion has new icons, new tokens, new mechanics, new card types, and new cards for all the existing card types.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O6CtUYU4HOS3FZo_3y0GZg__original/img/1czfyGgIUX1-9WqSRJOBX-lnC9A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4609328.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O6CtUYU4HOS3FZo_3y0GZg__thumb/img/0f1WoItL-88DMvEd5RP2UO7qdXE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4609328.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/274228","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"1"}}
