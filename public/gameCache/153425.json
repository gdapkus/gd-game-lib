As freelance trade captains, the players bring food and other goods to the cities, in addition to fighting the pirates whenever they encounter them. Fighting without cannons leads to poor results, however, and cannons are expensive. With each success, though, a player can better equip his three-dimensional ship and strengthen his crew.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who finds the best mix of trading and fighting will prove to be the victorious captain.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s_XtuTciFLBMZZDZIyHHjA__original/img/fV8zSbjLy9KrcUbyM-8xDCPZEqQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1993122.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s_XtuTciFLBMZZDZIyHHjA__thumb/img/RdXr5_sD18oLiH0r3N6Dr-DuvFo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1993122.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/153425","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
