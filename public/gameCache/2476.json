Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/guCc6SWoNZ-tJidpv6WQrg__original/img/WDAqVnYJEUpqQfSADG8e8d30xFM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic201576.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/guCc6SWoNZ-tJidpv6WQrg__thumb/img/p0FaY8CcK_oEN-7rf0TEY-8u-2E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic201576.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2476","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2001","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.66544","averageWeight":"2.6301","boardGameRank":"3032","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Hand Management","Open Drafting"],"categories":["Economic","Environmental","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["JÃ¼rgen Strohm"]}}
