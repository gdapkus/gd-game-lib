Players call out the action shown on their cards as fast as they can. When two players have a match, they celebrate by performing the action. Actions include the classic &quot;High 5&quot;, the unifying &quot;Pound It&quot;, the frantic &quot;Switcheroo&quot;, and the delightful and bizarre &quot;Happy Salmon&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each time a player celebrates a match, they quickly discard a card. The first person to get rid of all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qiPO300rG73UqxJvpUe3og__original/img/r-ZepVlPDZRwmxcWJgLA4GpaXfY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7354069.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qiPO300rG73UqxJvpUe3og__thumb/img/jo26IkaY-DSx4MhfRQ7lDHCPtbo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7354069.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/194626","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"2","minPlayingTime":"2","maxPlayingTime":"2","bestAtCount":[5,6,8],"averageRating":"6.67701","averageWeight":"1.0734","boardGameRank":"1605","mechanics":["Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Animals","Children's Game","Party Game","Real-time"],"designers":["Ken Gruhl","Quentin Weir","Matthew Inman","Elan Lee"]}}
