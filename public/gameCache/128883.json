Seven new countries and powers are represented.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rocket Technology allows you to build a rocket factory when taking the &quot;Design Bomb&quot; action. Rockets work exactly like bombers - but fighters provide no defense against them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    H-Bomb Technology upgrades the &quot;Design Bomb&quot; action, allowing a player to return an available bomb to the bottom of the deck in order to acquire an H-Bomb card. To build an H-Bomb, however, the player needs Lithium Deuteride, which comes from new cards that work similar to Mines.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Personalities adds seven roles to the game based on real individuals who contributed to the Manhattan Project. Each time you retrieve your workers you will select a different role. Each role will grant you persistent benefits until the next time you retrieve.&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uwrQ9j9autBmVaYkbmxqNw__original/img/y1M9xnO2NXY0dHep2A8eOT4WXzs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1431853.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uwrQ9j9autBmVaYkbmxqNw__thumb/img/W5333wEVH_vk1YSZLtLME5R8xA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1431853.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/128883","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.45926","averageWeight":"2.8214","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Take That","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Industry / Manufacturing","Negotiation","Spies / Secret Agents","World War II"],"designers":["Eric Jome","Brandon Tibbetts"]}}
