To do this, you must outsmart your rivals by being a clever investor, bidding on the right city tiles, and creating your own little district of Naples.&#10;&#10;Over the course of five game rounds, players first have to plan their actions carefully, choosing whether they want to invest in new pizzerias, make express deliveries, get sponsored by the bank, or decide to expand their district. Once all players have used up their action tokens, players get rewarded by receiving Lira, which they can then use in a bidding phase to determine how many deliveries you can make, and how many pizzas you can deliver. Once you deliver pizzas to your hungry customers, they reward you by boosting your abilities, making each action more powerful as the game progresses. Every decision counts, but Pap&agrave; Paolo is a very accessible game, which will charm players of all ages alike.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuPrKekvnJh7z8M7P63CPA__original/img/_mafZ24h92Sf2s6_yAsDQ9ec9BE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2960325.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuPrKekvnJh7z8M7P63CPA__thumb/img/Uhq9hlpdNHPlvEddoch_cmgWTLM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2960325.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/195867","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":"4"}}
