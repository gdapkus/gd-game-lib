    "description": "A special post card containing an exclusive expansion tile like the Polar Bear only for the Strategicon convention series where Michael Schacht was the Guest of Honor for Orccon 2009.\n\nPlease use the original rules with the following exceptions: the first player who fills his 6-space enclosure takes the enclosure as a bonus* and places it below his zoo board near his barn\n\nAs a money action, a player can discard a tile out of the game from a delivery truck. This costs 1 coin and may be done twice during the game. Keep track of usage by placing the spent coins on the King K. enclosure. Coins remain there until the end of the game and are not involved in the final scoring.\n\n\n    If King K is played with Grizzly, Polar Bear, and / or other similar expansions, the players filling their 6-space enclosures may select these enclosures in any order they want. \n\n\nExpands:\n\n    Zooloretto\n\n\nHome Page & Newsletter:\n\n     www.zooloretto.com \n\n\n(German, english, dutch, hungarian, spanish, swedish)\n\n",
