Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you'll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?&#10;&#10;The second edition of MicroMacro: Crime City now marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1M-1d6fr3U9t670MCVOTeg__original/img/QxxRpFr57KrNdyFSzslHPN95mSA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5896816.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1M-1d6fr3U9t670MCVOTeg__thumb/img/aR9LNVhRr_hnIIoYwxFUTb8rPMk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5896816.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/318977","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.48644","averageWeight":"1.1026","boardGameRank":"267","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deduction","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Murder / Mystery"],"designers":["Johannes Sich"]}}
