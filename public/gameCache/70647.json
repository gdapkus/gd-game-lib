This side-board expands the moon with a new territory, and introduces the nearby Asteroid Belt. Asteroid Counters move through the belt during the game, changing their docking requirements as they change their positions. Staking a claim to an Asteroid will give you resources, a derelict ship, or new alien devices. Outer Belt can accommodate 2 to 5 players (up to 6 players when combined with Alien Frontiers: Factions).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gF6z3xyw39uHvFPma-3STg__original/img/b3rtOyG5shxQGSV8DBQTSL9O0fs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2034204.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gF6z3xyw39uHvFPma-3STg__thumb/img/I5UTWhLUsoxXVIlygusMv-cBM6U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2034204.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/70647","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
