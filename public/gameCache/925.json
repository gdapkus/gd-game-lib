There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dbKLvMw--0rTKU5ShvZ79A__original/img/gxN0VrgnvVXk-Epp8F8nhpzhzvA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2453810.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dbKLvMw--0rTKU5ShvZ79A__thumb/img/yEhvq77CKOzj6MPQzoHcw-sQF1Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2453810.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/925","minPlayers":"8","maxPlayers":"24","yearPublished":"1986","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[13],"averageRating":"6.45661","averageWeight":"1.3885","boardGameRank":"2419","mechanics":["Hidden Roles","Negotiation","Player Elimination","Role Playing","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Team-Based Game","Traitor Game","Variable Player Powers","Voting"],"categories":["Bluffing","Deduction","Horror","Murder / Mystery","Negotiation","Party Game"],"designers":["Dimitry Davidoff","Andrew Plotkin"]}}
