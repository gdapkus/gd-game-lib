Set in a galaxy far far away.  You can choose to represent the Rebel Alliance, by playing Luke or Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, or R2-D2.  You can choose to represent the Galactic Empire by playing Darth Vader, Boba Fett, or a Stormtrooper.  The components of the game include brass imperial coins, and very nice pewter characters.  Instead of houses, star wars vehicles stake your claim on property, including x-wing fighters, TIE fighters, Corellian Freighters and Star Destroyers.
