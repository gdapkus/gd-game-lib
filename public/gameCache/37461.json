    "description": "Krakow 1325 AD is a 4-player card game full of trickery, which interacts with a map board. The game was first presented to the boardgaming world at Spiel 08 in Essen (October 2008) in two versions - English and Dutch.\n\nThe setting is Krakow, capital of Medieval Poland. The players form into two teams of ruthless crooks, which compete for influence and riches through a card game using a deck of 56 special \"Intrigue Cards\". But below the surface, things get uglier: every player has a hidden Identity and secretly competes against all others, including his own teammate. And there can be only one winner at game end...\n\nThe game comprises a mapboard, a card set of 56 Intrigue and 8 Special Cards, 4 Treasury boxes, 110 wooden Influence Tokens and 10 Victory Point/Turn markers.\n\nKrakow 1325 AD is a game of strategy and trickery, overloaded with original artwork and a warped sense of humour.\n\nIn October 2009, a 3-player expansion to Krakow 1325 AD was published (English/Dutch and German versions).\n\nThe game can be ordered directly from the designer/publisher by sending a private mail through Boardgamegeek.\n\n",
