The game consists of two decks of cards: One deck of 60 cards with four suits of cards numbered 1 to 15, and one deck of 60 rule cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has three rule cards, and at the start of a round, each player plays one of these cards. The rule cards played determine the rules for that round. There are three types of rule cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Trump cards, which determine the trump suit;&#10;    Scoring cards, which determine how many points a trick is worth;&#10;    Basic rule cards, which affect the way cards may be played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Now, a trick-taking game is played with the 60-card deck. One player leads a card and others need to follow suit, if possible (unless this has been changed by the rule cards). The winner of a trick leads the next trick. At the end of the round each trick is worth one point, modified by the scoring cards.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mld1iyDjZln4QxREMtE6sg__original/img/9JWsKENydqbYGS8ZYmJgifY0_7I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic797205.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mld1iyDjZln4QxREMtE6sg__thumb/img/DiDY86cGO-aKSVNvQatCwoXGiJc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic797205.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/81250","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
