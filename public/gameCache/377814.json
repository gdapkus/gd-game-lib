And thus, all those great profits from maritime trades become the territory of low-ranking knights and foreigners.&#10;&#10;Not only do the aristocrats provide you with various demands for your business, they are also prepared to give you the honour you deserve. Your voyages are also the light of hope for the Roman aristocrats who cannot row into the sea.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i91eE0Qv1mdCFgSRddyrpg__original/img/6hxQ5LYZSBZwrPRzPxl1sLpWyS4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7264561.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i91eE0Qv1mdCFgSRddyrpg__thumb/img/-POnKeJL4EiaE1ChH4C1vTzxLwQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7264561.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/377814","minPlayers":"0","maxPlayers":"0","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.08005","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":[]}}
