    "description": "Stich f&uuml;r Stich is a highly suspicious crime card game for all sleuths, confidants, and knife guys!\n\nFour shady characters and seven dubious objects play the leading role here. Only one confidant knows who the perpetrator and the murder weapon are; all the other players are in the dark. But every trick is a clue because the murderer and the weapon always come up trumps, so the sleuths track down the culprit trick by trick. At the same time, the confidant who knows what's what tries to mislead their fellow players with nasty tricks. Only those who keep a cool head during the investigation and play their cards carefully can convict the culprit.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
