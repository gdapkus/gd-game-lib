    "description": "The great Black Death has come to you in the Middle Ages, ravaging everyone you know. A Plague Doctor visits you. Can you trust him, and will you be next?\n\nInfected is a strategic, secret role social game where one of the party is a Plague Doctor, spreading the Bubonic Plague. The villagers need to find and rid themselves of the evil doctor before they succumb to the greatest plague in history.\n\nPlayers will try to vaccinate other players in their quest to gather information and protect each other, while finding the Plague Doctor.\n\nIf you are the Plague Doctor, you&rsquo;ll try to spread the disease as quickly as possible so that you are the lone victor.\nHere&rsquo;s the catch: no one knows who anyone else is.\n\nInfected is a fast moving game using strategy, deduction, logic, skill, and people reading.\n\n",
