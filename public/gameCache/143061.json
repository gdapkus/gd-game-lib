This is the heart of the expansion. It&rsquo;s kind of a back alley district in the Imp town where all the weird existences live and try to do their business. So would you like to hire an illegal worker or buy a pet on the black market? Maybe book a facility that produces food for active dogs, cats and dragons? And what about a fancy ribbon or a cool spiked collar for your pet? Taking care of your pets will never be the same.&#10;&#10;Box Contents:&#10;1 Two-sided Progress Board Extension&#10;1 Two-sided Dark Alleys Board&#10;9 Pets with rotating wheels&#10;10 Plastic Fasteners for assembling pets&#10;9 Plastic Imps (2 in each color, 1 black)&#10;3 Cage Tiles&#10;2 Addon Tiles&#10;2 Customer Tiles&#10;2 Exhibition Tiles&#10;3 Artifact Tiles&#10;6 Facility Tiles&#10;8 Accessory Tiles&#10;4 Permission Tiles (1 in each color)&#10;1 Rule book&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zk5OLQ7SIbyCYAZAZwW8Kg__original/img/8lKnCBWL3drPCyKGX_7wwJ4RMNk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1803897.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zk5OLQ7SIbyCYAZAZwW8Kg__thumb/img/YMXQgW469qoCsuDBqeo6EB5XhmM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1803897.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/143061","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.77187","averageWeight":"3.7647","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Humor"],"designers":["Vlaada Chv√°til"]}}
