Place pavilions to earn gifts from the emperor and redeem those gifts for powerful actions to make this the best harvest festival yet!&#10;&#10;In Lanterns: The Emperor's Gifts, an expansion to Christopher Chung's award-winning Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, players start with a small supply of pavilions. When you place a tile, you may choose to build a pavilion on that tile. When you make a color match on a pavilion, you earn a gift from the emperor, a new currency that can activate special actions, as defined by emperor cards.&#10;&#10;Two emperor cards are revealed each game. On their turn, a player can redeem two gifts to activate one card and perform the special action associated with it &mdash; make an extra dedication at the end of your turn, convert favor tokens into victory points, and more! These new abilities add variety and enhance the experience of Lanterns: The Harvest Festival while honoring the simplicity of the original game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdUwGw97-tIqmF1t2LJ5VA__original/img/gs6t5GQosZzBYj2RCWTqItZeBqc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3132462.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdUwGw97-tIqmF1t2LJ5VA__thumb/img/ZsdJWpatluAYKdp672lMd7S_tfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3132462.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/206244","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"7.26828","averageWeight":"1.7692","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Jason D.
