If, on your turn, you don't want to take the card that's currently in the center, you can put the pig chip from your supply on the card.&#10;&#10;This will have the following effects:&#10;&#10;     You're not taking part in the remaining negotiations about this card, meaning that the next time it would be your turn to take the card or pay a chip, you're skipped.  You play along normally once the next card is up.&#10;     When another player takes the card, which by now has one or more pigs on it, they put these pigs in front of themselves next to their face-up cards.  The pigs don't go into the player's supply, so they can't use them again.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: If all players place their pigs on the same card, that card and all the pigs are removed from the game.  Turn over the next card.  The last player who put a pig on the previous card goes first on the next one.&#10;&#10;Each pig is worth a plus point at the end, regardless of whether you've received another player's pig together with a card or haven't used your own pig and still have it in your supply.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ti-J-M_SsWvoAMdiq6slqg__original/img/dksfnBm7xQ6utEc_jPNBGeWk7_Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3805066.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ti-J-M_SsWvoAMdiq6slqg__thumb/img/yReWBNqe6WYQgv73dbj8Wh_FB4E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3805066.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/234160","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"5"}}
