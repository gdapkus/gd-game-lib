Trillions of credits are lost, stolen, or simply erased. In the days that follow, chaos ensues. The New Angeles financial system suffers a massive collapse. Each corp blames the others. And it's simply not a good time to be Georgia Emelyov (23 Seconds, 14), the former Titan Transnational employee who made a surprising move to Jinteki just before the damage was done.&#10;&#10;Even when there's no financial certainty, there's always financial opportunity. And in the wake of the Twenty-Three Seconds incident, much of that opportunity comes in the form of blood money...&#10;&#10;With its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards), Blood Money &mdash; the second Data Pack in the Flashpoint Cycle for Android: Netrunner &mdash; continues to explore the New Angeles transformed by the Twenty-Three Seconds incident and the events of the Flashpoint Cycle. You'll find a host of cards that focus on using wealth to build wealth. You'll find a pair of powerful Corporate Trace cards that you can play even if the Runner didn't just make a run. And you'll find plenty of people looking to take advantage of the chaos in New Angeles, from Prisec operatives and bounty hunters to news reporters and rumor mongers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ma2qBAUBmyWZ-IgfNhiRg__original/img/2XE6ufEw3Z_FexN80SnG2BcG5Bc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3082642.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ma2qBAUBmyWZ-IgfNhiRg__thumb/img/VBZhD9xvRllZkikrl00yTecxmD4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3082642.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/203186","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.19585","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield"]}}
