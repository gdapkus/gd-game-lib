Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.&#10;&#10;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!&#10;&#10;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.&#10;&#10;First Game in the King of Tokyo series&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__original/img/hSvWgiRYJCTTuoLOWTW3c8sYtl8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3043734.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__thumb/img/OfgWmkGJj5BgOO0zFHEtP5CHfbU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3043734.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/70323","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"7.12898","averageWeight":"1.4866","boardGameRank":"439","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Die Icon Resolution","King of the Hill","Open Drafting","Player Elimination","Push Your Luck","Re-rolling and Locking","Tags"],"categories":["Dice","Fighting","Movies / TV / Radio theme","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield"]}}
