    "description": "Does a sofa fit in a shopping cart? It all depends on how you size it up in this game of creative thinking and outrageous scenarios. Try to win a set of cards by fitting smaller things into bigger things - a baby goes in a bathtub, which is in a house, in Hollywood. Play the fourth word card to claim a set, unless one of your opponents can trump with a larger word. The player with the most sets at the end is the winner.\n\n",
