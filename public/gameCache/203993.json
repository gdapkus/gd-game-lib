To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements. In one location, they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories, sponsored buildings, influenced characters, or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards.&#10;&#10;Family members are not identical. At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...&#10;&#10;You can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn't prayed enough will suffer hard penalties. After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__original/img/dOiPu4wGisyuw3KxDketwCSpOfY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3175535.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__thumb/img/MoUo5LUThQh7CyxGX6QnPBM5zAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3175535.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/203993","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"7.84763","averageWeight":"3.2993","boardGameRank":"117","mechanics":["Contracts","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Open Drafting","Turn Order: Claim Action","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"categories":["Renaissance"],"designers":["Flaminia Brasini","Virginio Gigli","Simone Luciani"]}}
