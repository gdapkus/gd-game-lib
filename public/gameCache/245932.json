Each species has special advantages and disadvantages, and some species introduce new resources into the game. Each species has four unique rooms, and they replace rooms in the base game, which allows other players to gain the powers of these species.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cxdDVUhmWFwbSDFzzDL4-Q__original/img/dCoFrV504Oc0J2APXdTlSGSA0N8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4268584.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cxdDVUhmWFwbSDFzzDL4-Q__thumb/img/82Y-OEX_yW2DC7C6xciSDZYoHQY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4268584.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/245932","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"210","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"210","bestAtCount":[2,4],"averageRating":"8.24688","averageWeight":"3.8","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Tile Placement","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Animals","Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Farming"],"designers":["Uwe Rosenberg","Alex Wilber"]}}
