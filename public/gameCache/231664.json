Or are you confronting the danger and scaring your opponents?&#10;&#10;FEAR is a fast-paced and straightforward hand management game of tension-filled ghost chasing.&#10;&#10;You start a Fast Forward game without reading a rules booklet in advance! Just grab some fellow gamers and discover the rules while playing. The Fast Forward series uses the Fable Game system introduced in Fabled Fruit: With the presorted deck of cards, you will discover all cards and rules as you play. It will take 10-15 games of FEAR before your group has explored the entire system. It can then be reset and played again by the same or different groups!&#10;&#10;FEAR is the first of four completely different games in the Fast Forward series!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YMNF9s7UPOXm1KfoaGH-9Q__original/img/qjIRHFWelWvqc1n3JIpe3wZkJdA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3651975.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YMNF9s7UPOXm1KfoaGH-9Q__thumb/img/1erEtjZvodM2vfYMoXirnP2QvEs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3651975.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/231664","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.09763","averageWeight":"1.0952","boardGameRank":"5073","mechanics":["Hand Management","Push Your Luck","Take That"],"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game","Math","Number"],"designers":["Friedemann Friese"]}}
