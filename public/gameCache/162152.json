Seek the aid of magical creatures and use the different abilities their dice give you. Find your way with the aid of valuable spell cards and win the crowning achievement of your craft: the Opus Magnum. But never ever underestimate the power of the dice!&#10;&#10;In each round on Ci&uacute;b, you will try to make your dice show the combination on one of the spell cards in order to gain victory points. Different faces on the various dice will aid you. After you gain a spell, you will usually need to reduce the number of your dice, so planning ahead for the next round is key. At game end, the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUF_wbpAzexmZvDh5_sRaA__original/img/Tp_FwOmK9s1LSUX5cvpDMqGlobE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3989497.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUF_wbpAzexmZvDh5_sRaA__thumb/img/dQAvbADt1HnybohrT5m2CWubx1M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3989497.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/162152","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2,3],"averageRating":"6.13087","averageWeight":"1.9167","boardGameRank":"7509","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Set Collection"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["Thomas Lehmann"]}}
