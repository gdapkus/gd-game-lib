This was available through the Dice Tower Season 13 Indegogo campaign.&#10;&#10;Set the tower from the base game on the rocky crag space to the left of the red symbol printed on the board showing a 4th place one of the 4 eternal flames on the tower.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Varatan's Lighthouse at Klippenwacht has long since collapsed and fall into the sea.&quot; That's what the sea people said. But sometimes, far away on the northern horizon, you could see a shimmering violet light. At the eternal flame of the sort created by Hadrian wizards, perhaps?
