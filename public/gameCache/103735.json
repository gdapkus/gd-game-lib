You have raised a surprisingly similar flock of sheep to all of your neighboring farms. Because of this none of you can tell who is the finest at raising sheep. A cunning contest of sheep trading results!&#10;&#10;Each farmer secretly selects which sheep to trade with each neighbor, and which to send to the grazing fields. Lying and deception are of course the most important tools of any sheep trader. But beware &ndash; each farmer also has a wolf in his arsenal! Don't let the wool get pulled over your eyes!&#10;&#10;Each card in Bedlamb contains unique flavor text, and upwards of 30% of them are better than that wool joke.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fXLFiJU7GQY62Y8sy0IXbg__original/img/p5hAzXl51xgYXyMHBBAtBytu_eM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1052874.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fXLFiJU7GQY62Y8sy0IXbg__thumb/img/BFiBuT13l0O5lwjQg56Tic-bBho=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1052874.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/103735","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"5.05682","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Animals","Bluffing","Card Game"],"designers":["Chris Cieslik"]}}
