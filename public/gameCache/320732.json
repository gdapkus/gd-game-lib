You need two boards for each player, one for the Surface and one for the Underground. The basic Route dice are used on the Surface board (following the normal rules), while the Underground dice (and rules) are used on the Underground board!&#10;&#10;Note: at least one core set of Railroad Ink&trade; or Railroad Ink Challenge&trade; is required to use this expansion pack.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9-i9o0rwsFw5GSuMjpbCtw__original/img/7M58Ap3u9Xf222nlY7B4br63DHQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6197382.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9-i9o0rwsFw5GSuMjpbCtw__thumb/img/gyrivTPHQXM8ucWKo8VgY7XnJ4U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6197382.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/320732","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
