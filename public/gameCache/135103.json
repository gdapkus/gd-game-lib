Time can be manipulated. The fourth Data Pack in the &quot;Genesis Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner, A Study in Static focuses on developing each faction's traditional strengths even as it opens up new strategies for players to explore; each of the four Corporations receives a new piece of ice, and all three Runners receive a new icebreaker. New resources and agendas permit players to pursue tightly focused deck builds centered around an increasing number of tricks and traps. Meanwhile, A Study in Static also allows players to reevaluate their existing decks and reconfigure them for greater efficiency.&#10;&#10;With their advancements in ice, icebreakers, and hardware, the sixty new cards from A Study in Static (three copies each of twenty individual cards) escalate the game's cyberstruggles to a new form of art. No longer do the factions content themselves to building and breaking snares and subroutines; they turn their attentions to the flow of time itself. So much as time is a matter of perception and of movement, A Study in Static is a study in the ability to accelerate and impede the passage of time.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Eq7xO2BL7vHZeZUt292pMA__original/img/sGUzwluE7gnRIFJpx4Jgjm-c1xc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1535339.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Eq7xO2BL7vHZeZUt292pMA__thumb/img/M_CcMy2WgxPY3l76ijuYSF0_98c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1535339.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/135103","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.04986","averageWeight":"3.1765","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield","Lukas Litzsinger"]}}
