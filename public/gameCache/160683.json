You&rsquo;ll find a trio of Corp agendas with powerful &quot;when scored&quot; abilities and trace cards that can hit the Runner even if their traces fail.&#10;&#10;Data never dies. It just takes deadly new twists. Explore the ends to which they lead in All That Remains.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OdOQJa1CyO335qz_8OAQow__original/img/y4hrtXtZIpmanK1bzFXKVKSGfvc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2078343.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OdOQJa1CyO335qz_8OAQow__thumb/img/LpAKSfi8xYL1jKzqzXpUkOtd_e4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2078343.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/160683","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.17258","averageWeight":"3.5556","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield","Lukas Litzsinger"]}}
