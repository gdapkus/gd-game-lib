Each dice has:&#10;&#10;2 x Sushi (blue)&#10;2 x Fishbone (red)&#10;1 x Chopsticks (blue)&#10;1 x Chopsticks (red)&#10;&#10;There are 24 tiles:&#10;&#10;12 x Sushi (blue) ... Worth +1 to +6 points&#10;12 x Fishbone (red) ... Worth -1 to -4 points&#10;&#10;Players roll dice to try and collect &quot;Sushi&quot; and &quot;Fish Bone&quot; tiles from the centre of the board (the tile they get depends how many they rolled).&#10;&#10;Players can also steal tiles from other players by rolling 3 or more appropriately coloured &quot;Chopsticks&quot; on their dice.  3 Chopsticks allows you to take the top tile from an appropriate pile from another player, 4 or 5 chopsticks allows you to nominate which tile from the pile you want, but you are not allowed to look first.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game (when the tiles are all gone), players score points based on the tiles they have collected, however if you have more blue tiles than red tiles, you lose the excess blue tiles first!&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cU_FFruHtkJ8VHPOrwjSnA__original/img/wTpJiR76wZP2_0Z1DKAsnaXQEUw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic400677.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cU_FFruHtkJ8VHPOrwjSnA__thumb/img/PLW-r-C4dn2teaYE7NtjgVRIce0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic400677.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/37400","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.51024","averageWeight":"1.2287","boardGameRank":"2744","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Memory","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
