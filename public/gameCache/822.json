The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his/her meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him/her a hard time to complete his/her project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__original/img/aVZEXAI-cUtuunNfPhjeHlS4fwQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6544250.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__thumb/img/88274KiOg94wziybVHyW8AeOiXg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6544250.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/822","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.41053","averageWeight":"1.8909","boardGameRank":"231","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Enclosure","Map Addition","Pattern Building","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Medieval","Territory Building"],"designers":["Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede"]}}
