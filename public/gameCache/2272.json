Lucky die rollers can make use of the shortcut spaces to speed movement.  However, players can not pass their own pieces and landing on any one else's piece sends the landed-on piece back to the Base where it must start again.  First player to get all four pieces Home wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/an4-ELSc81tAp00L8PKXdQ__original/img/EPY1Nt4Bji_YLf3g0D1UsB9uaro=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic94779.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/an4-ELSc81tAp00L8PKXdQ__thumb/img/Mh6uFgoMNWNY2sA1Orc6izGhg1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic94779.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2272","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1962","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"4.90097","averageWeight":"1.2","boardGameRank":"27358","mechanics":["Roll / Spin and Move"],"categories":[],"designers":["Harry W.
