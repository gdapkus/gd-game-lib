Mr. Lincoln's War is organized into two games, the Army of the Tennessee, which deals with the western theater, and The Army of the Potomac, which deals with the war in Virginia. Each game has four short campaign scenarios that recreate the maneuvers and battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg, Atlanta and other monumental Civil War contests.
