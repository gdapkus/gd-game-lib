    "description": "Patent pending strategy game for 2 players.  Game is played on a grid of 62 dice (the dice matrix) that is randomized before each game, meaning that the board has a different layout every time you play (number of possible boards = 6^62 divided by 4 (symmetries)).  Navigate the dice matrix creating dice islands, whilst tied to your opponent.  Object of the game is to block or strand your opponent so that they cannot move.\n\n",
