But now great leaps of progress are being taken - hangars are being built, engineers taken on and engines constructed.&#10;&#10;After all the purpose of your own airship-hangar is to build an impressive fleet of these giants with a view to winning this exciting board game.&#10;&#10;Description from publisher:&#10;&#10;By cleverly combining the three colored dice with the values on the cards, you take part in building zeppelins and finally the famous Hindenburg.&#10;&#10;Ren&egrave; from spielbox.de:&#10;&#10;&quot;Giganten der L&uuml;fte (working-title &quot;Zeppelin&quot;) is a very tactical dice-game. You need mechanics, engines, and workshops....  Only the player with the best combination of those will successfully take part in building the Hindenburg.&quot;&#10;&#10;Giganten der L&uuml;fte is not comparable to Lucky Loop or Alhambra - the dice game.&#10;It is comparable to games like Kingsburg and To Court the King, where you use the dice as a form of resources to manage, as well as a method of purchasing other resources.&#10;&#10;Artwork by Jo Hartwig.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges: &#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Un0FNs6BqvYK6-c2PP2QcQ__original/img/9TuJYhSxQa4rEfIBUOia1hIvAtA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic296139.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Un0FNs6BqvYK6-c2PP2QcQ__thumb/img/HdZOmy3tX8_IojvUmd5oENBvZZ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic296139.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/32116","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.36459","averageWeight":"1.8624","boardGameRank":"3053","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Aviation / Flight","Dice","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["Andreas Seyfarth"]}}
