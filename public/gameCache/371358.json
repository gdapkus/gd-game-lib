    "description": "A one card assistant visits Naturopolis.\n\nPoints of Interest is a starting card that boosts your score if you surround it with the same type of block.\n\nThis is the first Point of Interest that introduces new rules. This rainbow is also a road, and it's a road that does not count towards your road tax. If you ever needed a little buff to help your score, Points of Interest is there for you, and this one can help prevent you from losing yet another point (actually 2 points in Naturopolis!).\n\nThis 1-card expansion (almost) mirrors Sprawlopolis: Points of Interest.\n\n-description from developer\n\n",
