Each player has some knowledge about which camels can move &mdash; and how far they can go when they do finally decide to move &mdash; but they can't be sure of when each one will move, so they'll just have to guess which ones will end in front of the others, hoping to earn a bit of money while doing so.&#10;&#10;Camel Up: The Card Game was first released as Camel Up Cards. The second edition of the game features revised artwork and a crazy camel similar to those in Camel Up (Second Edition) that race backward on the track.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8OA8L-EvrHSTIdLcZrZTJw__original/img/kvgIhqG6laLt_QiFlc5XilXonO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3152346.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8OA8L-EvrHSTIdLcZrZTJw__thumb/img/S0RNcItSGHd-qS_0qiRkWKnRG5s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3152346.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/192947","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
