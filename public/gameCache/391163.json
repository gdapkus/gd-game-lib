When the third winter card is drawn, the game ends immediately, then players tally their points based on the trees and dwellers in their forest. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Forest Shuffle is the first in a line of Lookout games sporting the Lookout Greenline label, produced on FSC certified paper and avoiding plastic completely.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/08bC8NviSTNc4Zvur4pueA__original/img/GcBtTHjdPXagHE-IOCpQ0he6rN4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7578350.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/08bC8NviSTNc4Zvur4pueA__thumb/img/Xq8TNBmMl3Z7DoynvbUXchFAztc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7578350.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/391163","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.65946","averageWeight":"2.1633","boardGameRank":"285","mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Layering","Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Set Collection","Tags"],"categories":["Animals","Card Game","Educational","Environmental"],"designers":["Kosch"]}}
