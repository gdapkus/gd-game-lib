With its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards), Upstalk transports Android: Netrunner to an all-new meat space: the moon, where life is one-point-two seconds out of the ordinary. Here, the game defies standard expectations. Runners and Corps explore new strategies, as do many of the game's cards and mechanisms. Here, Corporate trace attempts can punish Runners even when they fail. Corporate assets are everywhere, there's no life outside of Corporate-sponsored air, and there's a chance that those who manage or run the net may encounter a shard or fragment of the mythical source code. What can happen in one-point-two seconds? Everything!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TChFY738tTJFPbXItUjiTg__original/img/omRhmzvjQJAkeySxDaqiD1jjhCQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1940774.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TChFY738tTJFPbXItUjiTg__thumb/img/6Ht8qttkWxXPoQvje4lal6bDeww=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1940774.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/154544","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null}}
