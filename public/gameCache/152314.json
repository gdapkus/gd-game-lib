Credits may be cold, uncaring, heartless abstractions, but they offer an unavoidable truth: The more, the better.&quot; &ndash;Iain Stirling&#10;&#10;The network lies before you; which path will you take? Focusing primarily on the interests of Jinteki and three new Criminal runners, Honor and Profit is a deluxe expansion for Android: Netrunner - The Card Game. Its 165 new cards (three copies each of fifty-five different cards) feature a dizzying array of new tricks and traps, events to alter the tempo of the game, new psi talents, and six new identity cards that engender the exploration of all-new deck-building strategies. Additionally, fans of every faction will discover plenty to love among the expansion's neutral ambushes, ice, ops, AI, and connections.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pixgKoGa3YQ6WjcG_MhrPg__original/img/FO9QnBwWMcOgfMaZmDHurMwj0xI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1878471.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pixgKoGa3YQ6WjcG_MhrPg__thumb/img/CXd2prfURM0Xo_31UJZoB2dSu28=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1878471.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/152314","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
