They race to get their explorers to temples first and earn points. Along the way they can collect additional points by collecting items off the paths they create. The game ends when one player gets all of their explorers to their corresponding temples or whenever the last tile is drawn and placed. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;Description from the English Ruleset:&#10;&#10;Many moons have come and gone since your boats departed on the journey to Karuba. Once you arrive on the island, each player will lead an expedition team of four adventurers. Now you just have to navigate your way through the dense jungle to make it to the temples. &bdquo;Just&ldquo; may be something of an understatement; the ancient jungle trails have to be found and uncovered first! Hurry up and be the first to reach the temples to collect the most valuable treasures. Many paths have dead ends and you need to be patient to find the right/best way (through the jungle). Look! A gold nugget! You can pick it up and collect it, same applies to the shiny crystals along the paths.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__original/img/CJ-VpizVCicjpKS6Gs5hy9E74LQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2727088.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__thumb/img/_XHxgYraTvLmBnHpY8snFa2ma9o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2727088.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/183251","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"4"}}
