Once its drop is harvested, the empty ant is returned to the Anthill tile.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/chjShCzQViAxtMb84-B1cw__original/img/y4R35PmYBYqgp3W-4Wna6WTLwcE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5620616.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/chjShCzQViAxtMb84-B1cw__thumb/img/GdfQvRI3WOtWS2CIlyyPQm-z1PU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5620616.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/317578","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.788","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Modular Board","Voting"],"categories":["Environmental","Expansion for Base-game","Farming"],"designers":["David Chircop","DÃ¡vid Turczi"]}}
