The deck is playable alone but it is best when mixed with EIK.  The cards were developed and tested by users of Play-Agricola (aka Lookout Games' online test group) to fill in gaps in game play that had developed since Agricola first released.&#10;&#10;It was designed for use only with the base game. It has enough cards to play with 5 players.&#10;&#10;The artwork on the cards is entirely 100% drawn by the original Agricola/Le Havre artist.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2mK9Sm9LL3dBa1tOZlP_qg__original/img/QMAqzDUz9gvLFmomgjhCCMEkgr4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic832734.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2mK9Sm9LL3dBa1tOZlP_qg__thumb/img/M5DnR1TfzUGfhmdhqPiL7J0-574=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic832734.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/85704","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"150","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"150","bestAtCount":"4"}}
