Play the part like you always have, and maybe you&rsquo;ll survive. Frag this up, and you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d never been born.&quot;&#10;     &ndash;Ibrahim Salem&#10;&#10;Election Day is here in Fear the Masses, the sixth and final Data Pack in the Mumbad Cycle for Android: Netrunner! After the Indian Union's election cycle has hinged upon heated debates over clone rights, the election's final events will carry forward for many generations&hellip;&#10;&#10;Featuring some of the most potent and deck-defining cards from the whole Mumbad Cycle, Fear the Masses carries the cycle to its climactic conclusion, but leaves it to you to deal with the fall-out. Sixty new cards (including a complete playset of nineteen different cards), feature plenty to excite fans of both NBN and those Runners who identify themselves as Anarchs. NBN gains a new identity, a new region upgrade, and two potentially game-changing assets. Meanwhile, as they march against Corp HQs, the Anarchs rally the masses toward dissent and high-pressure discard strategies.&#10;&#10;Of course, there's plenty for every faction, and Fear the Masses offers neutral cards for the Runner that give you good odds of bypassing Corp ice for free, as well as a neutral agenda for the Corp that's worth two agenda points, but only requires three advancement to score.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jxkVVpSmZnGixWTzS_GZJQ__original/img/qepMHa66oI9MeewkMznjXNAKX0c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2956980.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jxkVVpSmZnGixWTzS_GZJQ__thumb/img/4INdDv_zUJKd0koxE-ig0YYSPv4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2956980.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/190021","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.03364","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Phase Order"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Damon Stone"]}}
