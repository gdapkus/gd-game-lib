    "description": "MATRX GIPF features the basic elements of GIPF combined with the move options from DVONN, P&Uuml;NCT, Z&Egrave;RTZ, YINSH, and TAMSK, opening up completely new tactical options that need to be mastered.\n\nMATRX GIPF can also be used as an expansion for GIPF.\n\nNote: You cannot play original GIPF with MATRX GIPF by itself, because MATRX GIPF has a different board and does not have enough GIPF pieces needed to play GIPF.\n\n",
