Explore all the classic rooms of the ghost-infested manor, from the festivities-filled Ballroom to the Attic and out to the Graveyard and beyond in search of spirits. Beware, though, of the Hitchhiking Ghosts, who are notorious for &ldquo;following you home&rdquo; as that may spell your doom in the end!&#10;&#10;Players gain points by socializing with ghosts around the Haunted Mansion. Players move around the mansion by rotating the Endless Hallway around Madame Leota's S&eacute;ance Room, collecting Ghost cards in front of them in sets, each of which are worth different point values. Players want to avoid Haunt cards, as the most &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; player will lose points. The player with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NhFR1vXQ7l3FAE-AimJQZA__original/img/DiEN3A6Pgi2FdcvHF6NT6SU5jic=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5523719.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NhFR1vXQ7l3FAE-AimJQZA__thumb/img/Ob0RvHgciBnXDjlJ837L6xKm4hc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5523719.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/309129","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
