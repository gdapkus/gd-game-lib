Nothing remains of the reported splendor of the Gardens, which were built for the eyes of Queen Amyitis.&#10;&#10;In The Hanging Gardens, players are landscape architects who attempt to reestablish the beauty and splendor of the original Hanging Gardens. Since there is no exact reference to follow, players create designs according to their own tastes.&#10;&#10;During the game, players acquire building cards, which they place in their play areas. Card follows card with magnificent buildings, sparkling fountains, and exotic plants, as the players work to rebuild the legendary Gardens. At game end, the Queen will reward the victory palm to the player whose work on the Gardens most impresses Her Highness.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mEKONuxvUvGJvFFFatqkTw__original/img/0pttFfpLOu8UXyV3VzatVHes2zA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic580143.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mEKONuxvUvGJvFFFatqkTw__thumb/img/f1rFs-fvAEXyuU2NZ50ZXHsc5o8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic580143.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/34707","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
