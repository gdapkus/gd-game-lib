While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing &mdash; and the stones to back up their plans &mdash; will prove to be Egypt's best builder.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkAt5n4R8XM0vNozl7fftA__original/img/934t5i7J90wlw6mb6p2m_3u98i0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3029488.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkAt5n4R8XM0vNozl7fftA__thumb/img/1JpxGZSWJf3mxnZZGaGOTqExoH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3029488.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/191862","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"4"}}
