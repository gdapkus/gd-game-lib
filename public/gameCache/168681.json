A team of the Kingdom's finest detectives has been assembled and put on the case. They have a prime suspect, they have a motive, and they know what the opportunity to commit the crime was. Now all they have to do is prove it.&#10;&#10;Using powers of deduction and communication, the players work as a team to eliminate dead leads and find clues to prove who, how, and why.
