On a turn, the active player rolls all eight Ubongo dice in the center of the table, then each player must grab exactly one black die and one white die. The player then uses the shapes on these dice to fill in her playing area, if possible. When a player completely fills the space, she yells &quot;Ubongo!&quot; and scores points. The other players continue to play until they have also completed their shapes and scored, then they move onto the next area on their scoring sheets.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after six rounds wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1PY-GpwFn9VMSCs2SvWj2w__original/img/cYjmJtqdkzElrSW-Iw1UflnKEcM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1538263.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1PY-GpwFn9VMSCs2SvWj2w__thumb/img/7Mh7nvkv-iOk5jNVQRA_J3bLYD8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1538263.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/136285","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"5.21576","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"24956","mechanics":[],"categories":["Dice","Real-time"],"designers":["Grzegorz Rejchtman"]}}
