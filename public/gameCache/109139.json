What's different about these buildings is that no direction is up, so when added to a player's Alhambra, the tile can be turned and placed in any legal position based on all the building rules except orientation. During scoring, these magical buildings count as a building of the appropriate color when determining majorities.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VaaGBsI9WByYb3RXcar1Dg__original/img/fd66t_vnmv6t8zX13I3sDD4mHHo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1102392.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VaaGBsI9WByYb3RXcar1Dg__thumb/img/vQvKiCQakIUFpcNMK8gkcHsYQPQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1102392.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/109139","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.33171","averageWeight":"1.8889","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Open Drafting","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["City Building","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Dirk Henn"]}}
