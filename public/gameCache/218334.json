    "description": "Tramways Expansion: Paris / New York, the first expansion for the Tramways base game, contains a mounted, double-sided game board with art deco graphics by Todd Sanders and a small sheet of rules for the twists:\n\n\n    In Paris, the players can move passengers along the Seine with boats.\n\n\n\n    In New York, the players can build big expensive bridges that will grant them more money and more happiness points at the end of the game.\n\n\n",
