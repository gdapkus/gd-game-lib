(In Japanese, hanabi is written as &#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1&ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1&ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.&#10;&#10;Hanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__original/img/5vNHZiTEhK4aRDuGXv5KImp9cmQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2007286.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__thumb/img/amCeCcEKhYGbVtDvpvIMnu3qTg0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2007286.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/98778","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"25","minPlayingTime":"25","maxPlayingTime":"25","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.03792","averageWeight":"1.6879","boardGameRank":"544","mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Memory","Ordering","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Deduction","Memory"],"designers":["Antoine Bauza"]}}
