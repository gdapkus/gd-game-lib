The package includes all of the cards from the German version K&#195;&#182;nig &amp; Intrigant as well as some, although not all, of the additional cards released under the German title K&#195;&#182;nig and Intrigant: Players&#039; Edition.&#10;&#10;The second expansion included in the package is the Grand Inquisitor and Colonies, which adds four new regions and two new actions, making seven total actions when used with the basic game's five.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sTr2jZZhus07Ten7datZNQ__original/img/WTN-OV9rhQlB3JWTUP1YAC6JU00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic63290.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sTr2jZZhus07Ten7datZNQ__thumb/img/nhfXyp_V4U89iQHYV5Xf2z-ZDsU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic63290.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/583","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"7.34376","averageWeight":"3.0833","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Political","Renaissance"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer","Richard Ulrich"]}}
