Players are the generals under the recently deceased Alexander the Great and recreate the civil war within the Hellenistic sphere of the middle east. The map is a point to point system, the counters are extra large and quite colorful and a deck of cards is provided that gives a refreshing twist to the typical war game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Successors: The Battles for Alexander's Empire&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gl3Zy0ZRU87klG89fc3tKg__original/img/hHvF0Yn3j11O56TqSKc6ni4q0xc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic290690.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gl3Zy0ZRU87klG89fc3tKg__thumb/img/KJFvydQQM6RwWdWrQq4oKUGby6c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic290690.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/68","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1997","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"180","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.03139","averageWeight":"3.2286","boardGameRank":"4647","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Point to Point Movement"],"categories":["Ancient","Wargame"],"designers":["Richard H.
