Once per era, you can place your Valkyrie on the launch board, taking a bonus as you do - the earlier you launch, the more choices you have. Then, pay the resource cost to obtain a new structure card from the special market. New cards will be available in each era, including such wonders as Beef Trees, Rover Factory, and Wormhole. These are added to your base, giving you even more opportunities for maximising your engine and constructing the most popular city on the Moon!&#10;&#10;Also includes three new Expedition and Reputation cards for the base game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YgdyugLasGZ4aJ-1rvc5ZQ__original/img/iIunZ3AcJ59U7UUs9gzkeKnUpbI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7427536.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YgdyugLasGZ4aJ-1rvc5ZQ__thumb/img/o_aLkSjWyg766c2dGcyX15ju8GI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7427536.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/382957","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
