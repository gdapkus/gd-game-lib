    "description": "Planepita is a dexterity game where players flick discs onto a central playing area. Discs in inner rings are worth more points than discs on outer rings.&#10;&#10;One side of the discs is magnetic, as is the board.  After a player flicks their disc, they may turn it face down, so that the eye of the piece is not visible and the disc is more firmly attached to the board.  A face up disc is more valuable than a secure face down disc.&#10;&#10;However, after all players have flicked their discs, any discs that are face up in the same ring as a neutral piece are removed from the board.  Then, by ring, players score points for having the most value of discs present.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after 4 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",
