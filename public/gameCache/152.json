For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up.&#10;    The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points. For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up.&#10;    Wimm&uuml;ln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.&#10;    Rumm&uuml; - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.&#10;    Safar&uuml; - A card &quot;catching&quot; game using basic adding skills. For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up.&#10;    Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards. For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set.&#10;&#10;&#10;M&uuml; is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.&#10;&#10;M&#195;&#188; and Lots More includes a a tweaked version of M&uuml; and a different set of games.&#10;&#10;2020 DiceTree Korean edition (titled The Last Panther + 6 games) includes Calcory and another new climbing card game &#234;&#184;&#176;&#235;&#147;&#156;&#235;&#157;&#188;(Ghydra) by Changhyun Baek.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/URjVVHsHtozP-wQUcfWgSw__original/img/j910ii0qHFjP4m8rf8Sr8GW3ojA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic149672.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/URjVVHsHtozP-wQUcfWgSw__thumb/img/fbqb-HnNal9CDUnkvIXU3UTsfgk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic149672.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/152","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1995","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"5"}}
