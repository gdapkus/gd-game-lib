When the timer runs out, players compare their lists of words and remove any words found by multiple players.  Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word.  (In the original Boggle, all words must contain 3 or more letters to score points.)&#10;&#10;An example grid given in the French Canadian rules (of Deluxe Boggle) holds an amazing 459 words!&#10;&#10;A number of variants have been produced by Parker Brothers over time, including Big Boggle (which uses a 5&times;5 grid of letters and forces players to search for longer words).&#10;&#10;Boggle is a word dice game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dsI6-jUj8mzOuC6gL4e42w__original/img/xf5XFqvj3TZxf3B_z9xR6lyGxic=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7024967.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dsI6-jUj8mzOuC6gL4e42w__thumb/img/YEc1l4n4HKd5_L1s1yTsqHyLjSw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7024967.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1293","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1972","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":"3"}}
