    "description": "Choose your dice cleverly in Ganz sch&ouml;n clever (German for \"That's Pretty Clever\") to enter them into the matching colored areas on your score sheet, putting together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and racking up the points! The dice you don't use are as important as those you do, because every die with a lower value than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times.\n\n",
