One or more modules can be added to the game in order to customize it to your liking (or to have a slightly different challenge each time).&#10; They are: &#10;&#10;     two extra rows of buildings&#10;     seven &quot;alternative rows&quot; of buildings (each replacing one of the seven standard ones; each player gets two of these during setup and thus has a slightly different board than the others to manage)&#10;     more than twenty Characters (each one with a special ability; every player gets one of them and enjoys his/her special power for the whole game)&#10;     more than twenty Events (they are shuffled and one is revealed at the start of each year, producing a special effect for that year only, which may be helpful, neutral or detrimental, but it's always applied to all players)&#10;     an alternative (deterministic) way to handle wintry reinforcements (rather than the die, each player gets six tokens numbered 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 4 during setup; at the beginning of each Winter you use and discard a token to get that many extra soldiers from the King).&#10;&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Kingsburg&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pznBi-DVWy3pfpBuzIZ1SA__original/img/mrciKjJKnaNHGjP-1vpYmB849Jo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1196154.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pznBi-DVWy3pfpBuzIZ1SA__thumb/img/F6Jipq016oRIHNyyQAomHRduQpQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1196154.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/39775","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.83949","averageWeight":"2.4541","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Open Drafting","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"categories":["City Building","Dice","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Medieval"],"designers":["Andrea Chiarvesio","Luca Iennaco"]}}
