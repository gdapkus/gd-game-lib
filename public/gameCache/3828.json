However, technical progress was due not only to the ever-growing traffic network, but was accelerated by the construction of more and more powerful locomotives.&#10;&#10;Locomotive Werks is an economic game in which players purchase the ability to produce engines, pay workers to produce them, and sell to the volatile, dice-driven market. The game is best known for its unique market mechanism in which the demand for older train models dries up, often at a rapid pace as new technology is implemented.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/86vu0XGjPDtZmwzG0D0fWw__original/img/mvLgd5Km9chLAK9SMwR2Yo_K4nw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1208369.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/86vu0XGjPDtZmwzG0D0fWw__thumb/img/NcRKxMz2vuhh52vXvHHgz_stGII=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1208369.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3828","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"6.76744","averageWeight":"2.8913","boardGameRank":"4883","mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Dice Rolling"],"categories":["Economic","Industry / Manufacturing","Trains"],"designers":["Dieter Danziger"]}}
