It arrives to X-Wing as a devastating Imperial starship in the TIE Punisher Expansion Pack, accompanied by four ship cards and a punishing array of nine explosive upgrades, with which you can obliterate your enemies. In addition to boasting a slightly larger payload than the TIE bomber, the TIE punisher invites Imperial players to perfect their bombing skills by taking advantage of both its innate boost action and its ability to equip a system upgrade like Advanced Sensors. With Advanced Sensors, the TIE punisher can boost into position to drop a bomb right in front of an enemy fighter, and then it can immediately perform its maneuver to fly away.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LybgQQsaptrtDZF44WX1SQ__original/img/h0XoJSM7ulFSYYKDRQfeJICIhOQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2786269.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LybgQQsaptrtDZF44WX1SQ__thumb/img/dczh784fsD65qzW94SYuuz76Pvk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2786269.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/176819","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"0","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
