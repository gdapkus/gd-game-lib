Are you ready for a new adventure?&#10;&#10;Dragons, Treasures &amp; Mysteries includes 3 new modules:&#10;&#10;The Treasures module provides new treasure chest tokens that each player receives at the start of the game. Each player will choose one to put somewhere on each of the terrain tiles. After all of the tokens are placed, they are flipped face up. If a player's explorer stops next to a token, they may meet a requirement, usually discarding a certain amount or total value of one color of card. If they fulfill the requirement, they receive the token. The token may be spent to move your explorer up to 2 spaces. However, if you collect 4 treasure chest tokens, you win the game immediately!&#10;&#10;The Dragons module contains 4 dragon pawns each in different colors corresponding to the cards' colors. The dragons start the game asleep and each on their own terrain tile. Once a player's explorer steps onto a terrain tile with a sleeping dragon, the dragon awakens and no one may walk through or next to it's space. However, once you play a card whose color matches the dragon, you may move the creature one space, potentially moving it out of your way and blocking your opponents! This module also includes new cards that allow players to perform actions relating to the dragons.&#10;&#10;The Mysteries module introduces new, smaller terrain tiles with dark mists. They are placed onto normal terrain tiles to add areas of mysterious fog. Once a player stops next to a mystery tile, it's flipped over and the layout underneath becomes visible. The player who uncovered the tile gains a bonus token and may then rotate and place it to create new terrain spots of jungle, water, etc. which are on the back of each mystery tile.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mxYBlQiNxekK4t_xPzoWsw__original/img/7h3JK_kK-wTaHQNX-DO3TYkQHmc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7278310.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mxYBlQiNxekK4t_xPzoWsw__thumb/img/ykRzwJ_8Yd571mSM3kpSPqAZgbc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7278310.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/377971","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
