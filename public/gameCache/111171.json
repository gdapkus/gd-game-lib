For the first round, the player order is 5,4,3,2,1; in all other rounds the order is 1,2,3,4,5. If you place an Errand Boy in the left gray circle (with a clock illustration), then your marker is placed on 1 and the other markers shifted right to fill the gap you left. Similarly, if you place your Errand Boy on the right circle, your marker is placed on 2 and other markers shifted right to fill any gap you left.&#10;&#10;The Last Will: Plan Order Board was first released at Spiel 2011 as a promotional item.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o4Dzb9BsH1Au2hFEX3qYFw__original/img/cOX0nVA1FrI_f-P64yM3J-QBxms=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1127724.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o4Dzb9BsH1Au2hFEX3qYFw__thumb/img/rYU1E7VdX2r21jvYQ3JYH3fXCpE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1127724.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/111171","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"6.77694","averageWeight":"2.5455","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Vladimír Suchý"]}}
