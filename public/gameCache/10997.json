To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems.&#10;&#10;Piraci features the same gameplay as Boomtown, but with the players now sailing the waters instead of panning them.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vhSwPyIL6n4kkmkaxfS6Zg__original/img/AzsipmdDiZ9JlDaF8HXTotF2u20=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic49310.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vhSwPyIL6n4kkmkaxfS6Zg__thumb/img/tBwBgfb9ySruH2saOLXoLucj4eU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic49310.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/10997","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"6.52449","averageWeight":"1.6947","boardGameRank":"2637","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Take That","Turn Order: Auction"],"categories":["American West","Card Game"],"designers":["Bruno Cathala","Bruno Faidutti"]}}
