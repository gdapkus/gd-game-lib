Settlers spread westward across the American continent, and railroad companies follow. Back east, sweeping laws are passed, and tensions between the North and South escalate into a civil war. How will these events affect the humble inhabitants of a burgeoning frontier town?&#10;&#10;Homesteaders: New Beginnings includes all the components needed to add a fifth player to the game. In addition, the expansion adds more auction and building tiles to give more variance to each play session. It has 25 &quot;jumbo size&quot; resource components, and each of these counts as five resources of normal size.
