    "description": "An alien parasite has latched onto ROVE and is crawling all over your modules. You&rsquo;ll need to figure out how to deal with this new challenge in order to complete your mission.\n\nROVE: Crawler is a single Module card expansion. Crawler is a new module that adds a neat little twist to the game: It has a new restriction (it must always cover a single module), its own ability and movement, and a special sort of passive ability. It's sometimes in your way and sometimes useful.\n\n",
