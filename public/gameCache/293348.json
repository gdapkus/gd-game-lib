    "description": "Welcome to Flesh and Blood, the new hero-centric fantasy trading card game, designed for incredible constructed, booster draft, and sealed deck play.\n\nPlayers setup the game with a chosen character, weapon(s), and equipment. Players take turns attacking with their weapons and/or using action cards which are played by \"pitching\" (discarding) cards to pay resource costs. Attacks and defense reactions are placed on a \"chain\" (queue) and resolved with damage inflicted based on the difference of values. Play continues until a player reaches 0 health with the opponent declared the victor.\n\n",
