Their actions have even helped to shape events on a galactic scale. These Droids are R2-D2 and C-3PO, and you can introduce these iconic Droids to your games of Imperial Assault with this expansion!&#10;&#10;Like other Ally Packs, the R2-D2 and C-3PO Ally Pack offers essential new cards and missions for both the campaign and skirmish games, alongside two detailed plastic figures required for fielding R2-D2 and C-3PO in Imperial Assault tournaments. For the skirmish game, this expansion offers Command cards that open powerful new strategies and a new skirmish map with two unique missions. The Rebel heroes in a campaign game also gain a new side mission and the ability to field these two plucky Droids as allies.&#10;&#10;This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Twin Shadows expansion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mmRwOY9NDb9wMicD-9o9Yw__original/img/cso2MS_kskOSZB2PXA56XM7FXdU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2473296.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mmRwOY9NDb9wMicD-9o9Yw__thumb/img/wrmodDHkdtkaJM3GT6B9hKPQDSM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2473296.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/175212","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.00899","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Role Playing","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Miniatures","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Paul Winchester"]}}
