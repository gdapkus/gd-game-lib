As coaches, each is deciding what plays to run in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Plays commences with the selection of a play card by the defensive player. He/she installs a cover over this card such that the offensive player can only see the players on the line of scrimmage. A &quot;shift&quot; card must also be selected that gives the option of shifting the defensive line to either side for the play.&#10;&#10;The offensive player receives the play card and cover and must draw the offensive play on top of the clear holder. This could be a combination of runs, handoffs and passes.&#10;&#10;With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.&#10;&#10;Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jaIPg-6SR2AC9OTK42N2-w__original/img/VLqTCEtZ0AH1sQICC8FxZjaxmaU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1651590.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jaIPg-6SR2AC9OTK42N2-w__thumb/img/y9UpdLyAU10jytJb1E8AvRLgfYw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1651590.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8570","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1972","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
