Temperance. Justice. The Tower. The soothsayer&rsquo;s tarot wove a tale of a grim future, hard to put out of your mind. But when you learn that four people have disappeared without a trace from an estate in French Hill, you begin to wonder if the cruel fate told in the tarot is meant only for you, or for the entirety of Arkham.&#10;&#10;In The Circle Undone Campaign Expansion, one to four investigators delve into the mysteries of Arkham&rsquo;s past, uncovering its macabre history and the motives of those who dwell in its shadows through eight scenarios, along with a unique prologue scenario. Will these chosen few embrace the fate they have been dealt? Or will they forge their own destiny?&#10;&#10;This expansion combines all of the campaign and scenario content from the original The Circle Undone cycle, which was the fourth cycle of expansions for Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Players only need a copy of the Arkham Horror: The Card Game Revised Core Set to dive into the story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/anXYz5VFKC4HUaDjUjmigg__original/img/yQL6OiAMun7huFUQAPiSkPt7_Dk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7410296.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/anXYz5VFKC4HUaDjUjmigg__thumb/img/zlECKtamA-xeeBJOSq1Wlie-rA0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7410296.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/382510","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":"2"}}
