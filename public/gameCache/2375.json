The board shows all the cards (except for the Jacks) of two (2) standard 52-card decks, laid in a 10 x 10 pattern. The four corners are free spaces and count for all players equally.&#10;&#10;The players compete to create rows, columns or diagonals of 5 connected checkers placed on the cards that the player has laid down. Two-eyed Jacks are wild, while one-eyed Jacks allow an opponent's checker to be removed. The game ends when someone has reached a specified number of connections.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VosGBqkOjkhgC2QFS1o3_g__original/img/ZIc1p75HIEOIwtKy9ZIHsP2l0zQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic212893.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VosGBqkOjkhgC2QFS1o3_g__thumb/img/PNwWrQIQNo757BtoW6Hniy3P-cw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic212893.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2375","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"12","yearPublished":"1982","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.13331","averageWeight":"1.3242","boardGameRank":"3352","mechanics":["Hand Management","Pattern Building","Take That","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Card Game"],"designers":["Doug Reuter"]}}
