    "description": "In each opening round of the trick-taking card game Nyet!, players take turns crossing out possible choices for starting player, trump, super trump, the number of cards you discard, and the value of tricks taken on a grid, leaving only one option in each category. Once the starting player is determined, that player chooses a partner, then the teams play out the round based on the conditions they collectively chose.\n\n",
