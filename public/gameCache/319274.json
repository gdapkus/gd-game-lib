No formal study of its layout has ever been done. The queen has charged you with exploring Undercity&rsquo;s depths: locating underground rivers, settlements, and the strange mushroom forests that bloom in phosphorescent caverns. The last cartographer never returned &mdash; but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have better luck.&#10;&#10;Cartographers: Map Pack 3, Undercity can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.&#10;&#10;It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring above ground and below ground regions and 3 new scoring cards, specifically for use with this map pack. Players must either draw shapes completely above ground or completely below ground, while also keeping all shapes connected to one another.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VBjrkPfOsRN9WM8ngio-ow__original/img/Ztn0-dEWNPk0lKfD56UfspIUEoQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5648475.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VBjrkPfOsRN9WM8ngio-ow__thumb/img/knnG_-X-ZiXeYUAOvC8nM3V4EKY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5648475.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/319274","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"75","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.80224","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Bingo","Grid Coverage","Line Drawing","Paper-and-Pencil"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Territory Building"],"designers":["Jordy Adan","John Brieger"]}}
