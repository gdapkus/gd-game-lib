Down the White Nile is the second Data Pack in the &quot;Kitara Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner &ndash; The Card Game, and its sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) reinforce the Kitara Cycle's focus on the tense interactions between Corp and Runner. These interactions hinge largely upon the secrets Jinteki's locked behind the doors of its Kisu2 Hospital.
