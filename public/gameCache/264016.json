It is contained in the Deutscher Spielepreis 2018 Goodie Box and was also given out at SPIEL 2018 for free at moses. Verlag GmbH's booth.&#10;The promo stories feature art previously released in other Black Stories editions, but the text is new. Thematically, the five stories are about the SPIEL fair at Essen.&#10;&#10;Black Stories are tricky, morbid, sinister riddle stories.
