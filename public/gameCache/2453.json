The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__original/img/sdX6o0TZpXjsDMw071k2P80wpYw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2197702.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__thumb/img/EBt2y7Awj5djyo185R7g6FV3P9g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2197702.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2453","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.85981","averageWeight":"1.7417","boardGameRank":"845","mechanics":["Chaining","Enclosure","Grid Coverage","Hand Management","Square Grid","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Territory Building"],"designers":["Bernard Tavitian"]}}
