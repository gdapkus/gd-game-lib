    "description": "In the Dragonlance Boardgame, each player commands an army of dragons in search of the fabled Dragonlance.  The first player to snatch the Dragonlance from the top of the central tower and successfully deliver it back home wins!  But be careful!  Your opponents will attack your dragons, trying to make them crash-or even steal the Dragonlance and use it against you.  The game comes with a large hex mapboard, 30 dragons figures in six different colors, two sets of rules (Basic and Advanced), Cards, dice, altitude markers and more.\n\n",
