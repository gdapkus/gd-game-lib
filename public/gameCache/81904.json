From Bear Riders to Mighty Bolt Throwers, these Dwarves can either bolster your forces in pre-made adventures or can be recruited into your custom armies using the BattleLore: Call to Arms expansion.&#10;&#10;With 40 new figures, 27 cards, and a rule book featuring 4 new adventures, the Bearded Brave has no shortage of new materials for your BattleLore games! Keep an eye on the horizon and watch for your short-yet-stalwart allies: the Iron Dwarves!&#10;&#10;(Note that the Cattle Rider card included with Bearded Brave differs from the one included with Scottish Wars. Whereas the Scottish Wars Cattle Rider card has only Trot listed as an ability on either side of the card, this one lists Trot, Bull Rush, and Raging Bull as abilities covering both sides.)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rv7oMkCZSfxEVcfGV2NwHg__original/img/TImbonV5MmIxlw1WD3favCeyAZY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic907100.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rv7oMkCZSfxEVcfGV2NwHg__thumb/img/-djRi5BYvJcHnxdJPaMWyIRiN1s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic907100.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/81904","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.62116","averageWeight":"2.6842","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Medieval","Wargame"],"designers":["Richard Borg"]}}
