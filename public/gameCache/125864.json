For game play, a double ingredient is handled exactly the same as the single ingredients, but of course count as two ingredients of that kind.&#10;&#10;If an ingredient is needed to complete an order, double ingredients on display must be used first.  If necessary, a player must overpay, which also applies to double ingredients played from the hand to complete an order.&#10;&#10;Also included with Spielbox Magazine #2/2015.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iw5UhOpPjjTJmHHOCVvZHw__original/img/alUABN0hhRxMYQCzoKtgkJfZ2bg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1331332.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iw5UhOpPjjTJmHHOCVvZHw__thumb/img/dvSc-ylhaSdO1qhgkGiXGIhARok=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1331332.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/125864","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
