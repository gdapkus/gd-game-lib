At the start of play, all colors are neutral and do not belong to any player. During the course of the game, both players must choose two colors. The goal is to make piles of five pieces of different colors whose top color is their own. Whoever has clever tactics, plans for the future, and uses the possibility of multiple moves on stones of their own color will ultimately win with a majority of the 5-stacks.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJhhsYCNMNgfB6S436ybNw__original/img/xb-DuKQxucm72nhPUvLmYf2nKmQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3320406.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJhhsYCNMNgfB6S436ybNw__thumb/img/We1vdHjogn3ltKcxqCcYd4F5gBw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3320406.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/217083","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
