On a new, huge city map, which seamlessly follows the previous plans, 16 tricky crime cases are again waiting to be solved by one to four amateur detectives. These are brand new stories, more sophisticated and criminal than ever before! The aim is to determine motives, find evidence and convict the perpetrators. An attentive eye is just as much in demand as creative powers of deduction to unravel everything on the 75 x 110 cm game board. As a little help, a magnifying glass is included in the game and the individual cases are again marked with symbols, so that parents can decide which cases even the youngest investigators may investigate and uncover. MicroMacro: Crime City 3 - All In can be played completely independently, no previous knowledge from the other two parts is required.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CO-yHM5TZsfgIm-RQnUwjQ__original/img/xbWIh8-w6iQdgf5IGS7cm0-FSYA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7316130.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CO-yHM5TZsfgIm-RQnUwjQ__thumb/img/EPzhClDXn7fI9pnztW2lk6iAwAs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7316130.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/364766","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[1,2],"averageRating":"7.86983","averageWeight":"1.0938","boardGameRank":"1663","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deduction","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Humor","Murder / Mystery"],"designers":["Johannes Sich"]}}
