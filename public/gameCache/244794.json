As well-to-do citizens in Mercado, gamers wander around the stalls, always on the lookout for special items to enhance their reputation. Noble shawls, elegant jewelry, or golden trophies &mdash; with such a selection, the decision is difficult. But those who do not carry matching coins can also be unlucky because the other players have the same goal and might grab the valuable items from under your nose.&#10;&#10;In more detail, different market stalls, each with one product, are laid out as panels in the center of the table. Each player has a personal bag containing different coins. On a turn, you draw three coins from it blind and place them at the market tables of your choice. If a player has paid all the necessary coins of a product, they receive the board and thereby increase their reputation. Some tablets bring extra privileges or seals, others bring counterfeit money that might wander into a bag. Who can buy the most valuable goods?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nmOdkK4deLdoffL3q0nNfw__original/img/NH-DOjmeg21o0srK--m8UAgpnwE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3958805.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nmOdkK4deLdoffL3q0nNfw__thumb/img/2EnsYEu-3KQBWbtewOrno52xZtw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958805.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/244794","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.56031","averageWeight":"1.8889","boardGameRank":"5292","mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Auction / Bidding","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","End Game Bonuses","Market","Race"],"categories":["Economic","Renaissance"],"designers":["RÃ¼diger Dorn"]}}
