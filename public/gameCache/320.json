Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mVmmntn2oQd0PfFrWBvwIQ__original/img/11jrKPiOVTNl5NwX83KGtTZEq40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic404651.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mVmmntn2oQd0PfFrWBvwIQ__thumb/img/RUmuGCB40FQH0en0R2nrcsSO7DE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic404651.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/320","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1948","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
