Tower segments are added to the game, as well as some new actions.  Instead of placing a Meeple as usual on their turns, players can now either place a tower segment on a tile with a space for a tower, add a tower segment to a tower already standing, or place a Meeple on top of a tower (which &quot;finishes&quot; it).&#10;&#10;Placing a tower segment allows you to capture other players' Meeples, so long as they are in view of the tower in an orthogonal direction.  If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P42FlP0SXP4mU6jGVpxLiA__original/img/OHLjk7e3VtM1hVcpx4A6Cs4tp_s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3763555.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P42FlP0SXP4mU6jGVpxLiA__thumb/img/dmVXydki-L7XIqagwRLFUbl6Pn0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3763555.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/21385","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
