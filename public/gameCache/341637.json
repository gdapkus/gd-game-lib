Lulu uses time and natural magic for explosive combat and to survive the harsh environment where her city, Gorrenrock, stands.&#10;Lulu is a very hardy fighter and direct combat is her style of choice. Lulu has the ability to bolster her companions, granting them imbued strength in the form of status tokens and the special Spark alteration. At any turn, one of the fighters of Gorrenrock can exert themselves and fire off a final blast of damage, showing that no ally of Lulu&rsquo;s is going down easy. And when bolstering her allies isn&rsquo;t enough, Lulu is more than ready to take matters into her own hands with her signature attack, Phoenix Barrage! With the power of the Phoenix within her, Lulu can launch three spirited blasts of fire- -- with one aimed straight at her final foe!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z8gSZQny-qQyV1AjXrG1Pw__original/img/87YxY_XEgGflIDZZt3v1OM47biY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6257504.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z8gSZQny-qQyV1AjXrG1Pw__thumb/img/OhWltJHgFwIlh8XnFkchLyZ7fq0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6257504.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/341637","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.36","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Card Game"],"designers":["Isaac Vega"]}}
