A heavily armed transport, the VT-49 Decimator is one of the Empire&rsquo;s most feared warships, often used to provide long-range reconnaissance or to deploy raiding parties past enemy forces.&#10;&#10;The VT-49 Decimator Expansion Pack brings this intimidating Imperial gunboat to X-Wing as the game&rsquo;s largest ship yet designed for Standard Play. Even at the game&rsquo;s signature 1/270 scale, the expansion pack&rsquo;s detailed miniature towers over its base and smaller starfighters.&#10;&#10;In addition to its imposing, pre-painted miniature, the VT-49 Decimator Expansion Pack introduces four ship cards, three debris cloud tokens, a new mission, a maneuver dial, and all the tokens you need to fly your Decimator into the thick of combat. Finally, you&rsquo;ll find thirteen upgrade cards, which introduce a variety of crew members like Mara Jade and Fleet Officer designed to help you fill out the Decimator&rsquo;s three crew member slots.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nSIe79DDbmB9CvZYYxpFZQ__original/img/OzD8TdmmcyXlfIrko39NUrPN0Hg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2078340.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nSIe79DDbmB9CvZYYxpFZQ__thumb/img/MN0latNS5huY6kfbNV0-udw-ntg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2078340.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/161031","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
