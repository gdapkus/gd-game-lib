Tiles come in five colors numbered 0-10, and when you place the second tile of a color, you lock in whether you're ascending or descending in that color. For example, if you take a blue 2, then a blue 4, you can place only blue 5-10 in the future. Some tiles have a symbol that grant you another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is flipped, the game ends after that player finishes their turn. If you've collected only 1-2 tiles of a color, you lose points; the same applies if you collect fewer than two &quot;wishing stones&quot;, a symbol scattered across multiple colors. Sum your score for all five colors and wishing stones, then add any bonus points on tiles you collected. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LsonZxZdLOACyTpL7r7W2g__original/img/xWTu6R_qpsVUwKcReukggGOVbaY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic446261.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LsonZxZdLOACyTpL7r7W2g__thumb/img/JNk9Z87gPUH8YIk8_0gI3Vj6Gb4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic446261.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/41003","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.44204","averageWeight":"1.2523","boardGameRank":"3823","mechanics":["Push Your Luck","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Ancient","Exploration","Number"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
