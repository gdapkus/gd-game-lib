As there are multiple ways to score points and multiple takes on the submarine-upgrading order, the game offers several ways to win. The whole game takes mere 15 turns, each one of them simultaneous between all players, which makes it a fairly quick family game.&#10;Even though the submarines have the same abilities game-wise, each looks differently, and a special attention was obviously given also to the depiction of marine life.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pSz89XjEGXbZZn5ROo45EQ__original/img/Wm4nqb0UNLmG4ISVBzDRN925A7U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3014888.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pSz89XjEGXbZZn5ROo45EQ__thumb/img/Rbz9RYPUhHIpxOHRNxcgKhzTAQc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3014888.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/192860","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.7911","averageWeight":"1.8289","boardGameRank":"1768","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Animals","Exploration","Nautical"],"designers":["Antoine Bauza"]}}
