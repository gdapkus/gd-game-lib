You are mining for copper and tin, attempting to sell when the prices are high. To reduce the cost of mining you can place developments, such as ports, adits, and trains.

The earlier you invest the better the return.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__original/img/IQcVH_ftaU0vTLCO2HOHnIjiXm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic464133.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__thumb/img/GFKso8zlK2c73yUFCTdLITndS_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic464133.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/35570","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.206","averageWeight":"2.8281","boardGameRank":"1001","mechanics":["Action Points","Auction / Bidding","Dice Rolling","Turn Order: Time Track"],"categories":["Economic","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["Martin Wallace"]}}
