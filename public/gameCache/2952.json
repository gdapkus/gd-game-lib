The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CSILODNknzqhsDxeP8jmgw__original/img/ipoGqNe4Dt7hAF3pzd5bxWnKoEQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6912883.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CSILODNknzqhsDxeP8jmgw__thumb/img/y7sMTmQw3P-tX8MvFQImbf4pUFs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6912883.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2952","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"24","yearPublished":"1981","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"5.25065","averageWeight":"1.6327","boardGameRank":"27360","mechanics":["Roll / Spin and Move","Set Collection"],"categories":["Party Game","Trivia"],"designers":["Scott Abbott","Chris Haney"]}}
