    "description": "Carcassonne: Die Erweiterung (later prints used the title Inns &amp; Cathedrals) is the first major expansion for Carcassonne and introduces a few new aspects to the game.  There are a couple of completely new kinds of tiles - the inns and cathedrals.  There are also new tiles that present cities, roads, and cloisters in new shapes.  Additionally, each player gets a &quot;big meeple&quot; which counts as two regular meeples.  Another whole set of meeples means 6 players can now enjoy the game.  Finally, a set of scoring cards helps make score-keeping a little clearer.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",
