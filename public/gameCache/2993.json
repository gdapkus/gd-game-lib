There are a couple of completely new kinds of tiles: the inns and cathedrals.  There are also new tiles that present cities, roads, and cloisters in new shapes.  Additionally, each player gets a &quot;big meeple&quot; which counts as two regular meeples.  Another whole set of meeples means 6 players can now enjoy the game.  Finally, a set of scoring cards helps make score-keeping a little clearer.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g9q--tONTL86x2D4NKiM8g__original/img/r3cKL28WlWl1jNGzetER6B8A5hM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2659943.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g9q--tONTL86x2D4NKiM8g__thumb/img/opBzVTp4iK4LfozCr3doTYGwTHE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2659943.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2993","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2,3],"averageRating":"7.63734","averageWeight":"1.927","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","City Building","Medieval","Territory Building"],"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"]}}
