On this epic ascent, keep your eyes peeled for beautiful prayer flags and looming pillars of ice. This mountain is as beautiful as it is dangerous. Don&rsquo;t let it win.&#10;&#10;Unsurmountable: Big Climb includes 6 new cards, increases the size of the mountain to a whopping 15 cards, and also includes two new features: prayer flags and seracs. These are powerful factors in any climb that uses the optional difficulty rules.&#10;&#10;And for all the serious mountaineers out there, this expansion can be combined with Unsurmountable: Dual Peaks: if you can complete a 15-card mega-mountain with 2 peaks, you&rsquo;ll be on top of the world.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eaI6VFktgjjnVvSgy7qzfg__original/img/gRuV-jU8BEoP4w3S80G6_WFY4Wk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6389816.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eaI6VFktgjjnVvSgy7qzfg__thumb/img/USRtQ0ZRI-P7v-smi_vrI1yfogk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6389816.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/346901","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"1"}}
