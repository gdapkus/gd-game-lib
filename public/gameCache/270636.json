Three dice are thrown on each turn. With one die, the active player selects a new expansion for their farm, and the combination of the other two dice dictates which field will be activated on the farm &mdash; not only for the active player, but for all others as well. The expansions enhance the actions that players use to milk cows, shear sheep, harvest honey, or collect eggs, and these raw materials can then be sold. In the end, whoever makes the most money wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gc7UdItE2rE22W3RyMYr9A__original/img/nCru__DfDClROU0JCCgcu-9cEdo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5242786.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gc7UdItE2rE22W3RyMYr9A__thumb/img/9XFFgn0_LA6srwPofOrnkBuWRo8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5242786.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/270636","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.97941","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"2752","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Random Production"],"categories":["Farming"],"designers":["RÃ¼diger Dorn"]}}
