You can also engage yourself in trade with frankincense or gold for sestertii and victory points at the end of the game.&#10;    In Creta, you play on a tight map containing only twenty cities in nine provinces (one with only a single city).&#10;&#10;&#10;Both maps can be played at all player counts, but become very competitive with four and especially with five players. The maps also have a new format which is a little longer, but clearly smaller than previously released maps.&#10;&#10;The two-sided personality card display is separated from the map and contains a side with different additional costs.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgcdICSUrooYhNEEkXuV_w__original/img/gdgKrCE9Ytt_Ikwzz0w3BEaMNWo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8311470.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgcdICSUrooYhNEEkXuV_w__thumb/img/bvrZSubt8uMhVH1S9n1UzJF9wx0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8311470.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/232917","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
