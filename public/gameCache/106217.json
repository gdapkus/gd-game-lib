Restlessly, they'll move their pieces on the game board, facing constant challenges in terms of making their beautiful villages on this beautiful island as profitable as possible. Only those who will be able to use their dwindling resources to meet the increasing demands over five rounds will find a spot for themselves on the beach.&#10;&#10;In Hawaii, players must make use of their limited resources to score points by growing their villages and exploring the surrounding islands. Your chieftains move around the board to purchase new tiles for their villages, hopefully grabbing the best deals before their opponents. Three different currencies are used to pay for these trips, so make sure you don't run out of any of them too quickly. Players are also rewarded for providing for their people (measured essentially by how much they bought on a given turn), but your meager income shrinks as the game goes on. Players will have to balance a number of ways to score points to secure their victory.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9k84Frsbo6DyVaMR0mxaqA__original/img/E2FKjg1xbWTnwtgC1xRmmB-tL0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1188333.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9k84Frsbo6DyVaMR0mxaqA__thumb/img/G055Yf6D124jg0uNGO_LGrerkAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1188333.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/106217","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
