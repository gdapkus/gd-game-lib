The world of BattleLore meshes history and fantasy together - putting players in command of an array of miniature troops on the battlefields of a Medieval Europe Uchronia at the outset of the Hundred Years War.&#10;&#10;Drawing on the strengths of Memoir &#039;44, this Days of Wonder game takes the time-tested Command and Colors system to a new level and offers gamers of many backgrounds a chance to fight medieval battles with a dose of epic fantasy.&#10;&#10;In this fantastical re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, French and English armies are supplemented with Goblins and Dwarves mercenaries and even some creatures like the Giant Spider and the Earth Elemental! Just as important as the armies you have, though, are the Lore Masters you choose to aid you: Wizards, Clerics, Warriors and Rogues can all aid you with unique powers and spells in ways role-playing gamers will find familiar.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAH5iJ9gQ7aAj4iwUJyvUg__original/img/vzVTCZwGYDo2Shc9kCsMb87--p4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic145116.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAH5iJ9gQ7aAj4iwUJyvUg__thumb/img/rTfeifO7GrjUv30f_dAs1wbcHLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic145116.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/25417","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.34847","averageWeight":"2.7655","boardGameRank":"538","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Command Cards","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Fantasy","Medieval","Miniatures","Wargame"],"designers":["Richard Borg"]}}
