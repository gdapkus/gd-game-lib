These challenges aren't easy as some colors shouldn't touch one another.&#10;&#10;Fast puzzle-solving is important, but more than that in the end whoever solves the most of these difficult tasks wins.&#10;&#10;NOTE: IMPORTANT RULE CORRECTION&#10;&#10;Game description from the Thames &amp; Kosmos 2015 Science Kits &amp; Games catalogue:&#10;&#10;Dimension&#10;&#10;The Spherical, Stackable, Fast-Paced Puzzle Game!&#10;&#10;Dimension is a fast-paced, innovative puzzle game that takes place in three dimensions with 60 colourful spheres.&#10;&#10;All of the players play at the same time.&#10;&#10;Everybody tries to position the spheres on their tray to earn as many points as possible. The task cards indicate how the spheres must be placed to earn points: for example, exactly two orange spheres must be on the tray, black and blue must touch each other, and blue must not touch white.&#10;&#10;Complete these tasks while racing against the timer. You get a point for each sphere you use and a bonus token for using all five colors, but you lose two points for each card you don't follow correctly.&#10;&#10;Prove to your opponents that you are the master of multi-dimensional thinking!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vj0m4_QxSOH4MgQe-b0EYg__original/img/UJHuEOJ6JyIh_n3JBJrzHpvqYec=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2606156.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vj0m4_QxSOH4MgQe-b0EYg__thumb/img/B_wvuclpX40akpCr9L7rPiu7QTg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2606156.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/153318","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.85255","averageWeight":"1.375","boardGameRank":"2265","mechanics":["Pattern Building"],"categories":["Puzzle","Real-time"],"designers":["Lauge Luchau"]}}
