    "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThe players in the game run the last bastions of human control, corporations. Governments long ago failed after being dismantled by Emperor Trump. In A.I., corporations are trying to continue to line their pockets with the use of technology, except the technology is starting to work against that. Players are trying to profit handily while staying one step ahead of the A.I., which is starting to think of humans as a virus in the physical world.\n\nA.I.&rsquo;s key mechanism is the idea of an engine-building game with a potentially intelligent engine. In most engine-building games, players assemble an engine through the acquisition and management of resources to construct from a selection of parts. At some point in the game, the engine that will be run for the sole purpose of making victory points. The interesting decisions in these games is when to make that shift.\n In A.I., the engines have a chance to become sentient and could actually become part of a dummy player in the game that both hinders the ability of the player to progress and competes against all players to possibly win the game.\n\n",
