In others, the Renaissance produces a plutocracy, which leads to a utopia &mdash; or perhaps to anarchy; it's all in the subtle details. As a time-traveler, you've seen it all, and it all has its place. What's important is who's in control in the long run when time travel is invented. With other time-travelers mucking with things for their own reasons, your course is clear: you will tamper with history as much as is needed, stepping on however many butterflies it takes, to get a perfect world under your own benign rule.&#10;&#10;In Temporum, the board shows the possible paths history can take and the actual path it currently takes. On your turn, you can change history, travel through time, and visit a point in history. You draw cards, play some of them for money and abilities, and score some of them to advance your power through history. Having more power in a time period gives you abilities, but your goal is to have all of your power in the last time period, the time from which you come.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0JBjIEsxbEXqhl-AZHlj6Q__original/img/CrFXhJfnbRn8f2_L5GYe5NwQ2N0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2073914.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0JBjIEsxbEXqhl-AZHlj6Q__thumb/img/u9HeYUndzh9Mjm0B3k0vdlONRCQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2073914.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/162263","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"35","minPlayingTime":"35","maxPlayingTime":"35","bestAtCount":"3"}}
