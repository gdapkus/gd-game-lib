Townspeople go about the business of living - buying houses, having children, marrying, earning an honest coin and trying to get one up on their neighbors.&#10;&#10;However, their way of life is under threat...a plague of rats has arrived. As the number of rats rise the levels of food and romantic thoughts dwindle.... where is the Pied Piper when you need him ? Beware though, the Pied Piper plays his music at a price and his talents stretch beyond simply charming rats.&#10;&#10;Players score points for houses, influence, money and possession of the cat. Losing children to the Pied Piper is considered bad form and will lose you points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i8TDcjeXd18xThHYZXXdmQ__original/img/9bXKh4x6-hGlpdKY8K6D--LICF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic156544.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i8TDcjeXd18xThHYZXXdmQ__thumb/img/Wp2IEoZ8bw6qmHotyxgbzDqEBOY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic156544.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/23848","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
