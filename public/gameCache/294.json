Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.  Re-tooled, this game was re-released as Aladdin's Dragons in 2000.&#10;&#10;Keydom is Richard Breese's second game in the key series.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FygbwlRjyNnl1uZMa8WmIA__original/img/3bMbq3qZiHJI8gX1aK_L8SDguKI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic560205.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FygbwlRjyNnl1uZMa8WmIA__thumb/img/qizQEjSy4b99xy8NxRtr69-YCy8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic560205.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/294","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"1998","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.80529","averageWeight":"2.7143","boardGameRank":"12027","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Auction: Multiple Lot","Set Collection","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Bluffing","Fantasy","Medieval"],"designers":["Richard Breese"]}}
