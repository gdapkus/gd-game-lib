Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&mdash;all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vNFe4JkhKAERzi4T0Ntwpw__original/img/rqcUdtu_N4v-SpI96XVmpYHnJww=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8234167.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vNFe4JkhKAERzi4T0Ntwpw__thumb/img/KKU_42Uswt4tKCpf1zY5kTzgr-g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8234167.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148228","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
