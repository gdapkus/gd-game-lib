There's a moose loose in the kitchen... and another in the bathroom! In this silly matching card game, the goal is to keep moose out of your house, while at the same time giving them to your opponents. Use a door to close off empty rooms, or if you're lucky, plant a moose trap to keep those lovable but uninvited visitors away! The player with the fewest moose wins.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;20 Empty Room cards &#10;20 Moose in the Room cards &#10;10 There's a Moose in the House cards &#10;5 Door cards &#10;3 Moose Trap cards&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UumOIGIBCEqKE9XnGd0__Q__original/img/wNyn39YXfk8mRhae6XMnMzOJD9c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic974382.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UumOIGIBCEqKE9XnGd0__Q__thumb/img/_WjLt-p6JZ9fUTVP5EK6NQ7lZQg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic974382.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/12063","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"4"}}
