With a game play focused on high-octane conflict fueled by raging war and cutthroat politics, it also introduced players to a rich science fiction setting, with its own back story and its own secrets. Exodus: Edge of Extinction expands both the gaming and the narrative aspect of Exodus: Proxima Centauri into an even more epic space strategy empire building game.&#10;&#10;Exodus: Edge of Extinction represents the next chapter of an immersive story in which the remnants of humanity go to war against each other over a system they believe to be Proxima Centauri. Each player leads one of six unique factions with their own histories, strengths, unique special abilities and a set of new, exclusive technologies.&#10;&#10;Exodus: Edge of Extinction also brings larger fleets, custom action cards and completely new mechanisms like the Combat Cards, adding a whole new layer to the spectrum of strategies already available in the base game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MmUTvowBim0ffkXEhnjilA__original/img/ABNncWnTiz2s_FoIE3cwrnBd8sQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2554664.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MmUTvowBim0ffkXEhnjilA__thumb/img/nSsJUyj3k3jNQj-s_PGvJgvTcQw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2554664.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/170855","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
