You know him, you love him, it&rsquo;s the wacky and wonderful Merc with the Mouth, Deadpool! This fourth-wall-breaking hero has finally arrived in Marvel Champions: The Card Game, and he&rsquo;s coming in a larger Hero Pack than the others! Deadpool&rsquo;s all about risk-reward gameplay, with an ability that makes him nearly immortal but also adds acceleration tokens to the main scheme. His pack also comes with a brand-new aspect for the game: the &lsquo;Pool aspect! In this 78-card Hero Pack, you&rsquo;ll find Deadpool, his fifteen signature cards, and a bunch of &lsquo;Pool aspect cards for you to play around with, including some extras in the back of the pack for you to experiment with!&#10;&#10;No Marvel game would be complete without Deadpool, and Marvel Champions would not be complete without the Deadpool Hero Pack. This expansion comes with a 40-card pre-built deck, giving you the chance to start playing from the moment you open the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xq253U6KUrVTo21aSi_JtA__original/img/YPv2QL0oOh6bCGd3kblRt9TLkew=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7672632.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xq253U6KUrVTo21aSi_JtA__thumb/img/m3eX5bd8YAPO2-82MV7LbDA0-4I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7672632.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/398039","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"1"}}
