Each player runs a shipyard and tries to assemble ships of various sizes in order to ship goods with those same vessels. Time is short as each action can be executed only once per round, assembly of the masts and sails must be precisely coordinated, and the goods can be shipped only when the ship is complete. Thanks to the customized action wheels, everyone is always involved in the game's rapid sequence of actions.&#10;&#10;Whoever builds the biggest ships and ships the most valuable goods will be the winner in the end.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5dgtvEMuEuj2304pPYUcUg__original/img/rYDfgnlPOeq1QAk8DJFetyC1qRk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1708341.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5dgtvEMuEuj2304pPYUcUg__thumb/img/HQ_zoNoqaBugzkBhMdJBcGKutAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1708341.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/144415","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"3"}}
