    "description": "The first expansion to Cutthroat Caverns, Deeper &amp; Darker adds fifteen new monsters to hinder your quest to escape alive with the Sacred Item of Unimaginable Marvel...which means fifteen new monsters to use against your &quot;friends&quot; that are trying to escape with your artifact. It also adds some impact to character choice--each now has a unique ability, usable once per game, that might give you that special push that you need to make sure that you're the one left standing with the most Prestige when the dust settles.&#10;&#10;",
