So the eariest trains are 2+0s instead of 2+1s, but they cost less. Some are better than the norm and cost more. Some rust early, some late, and there are some slightly weird historical twists in there too, The later trains (D - H) operate in a slightly different way from the originals. The number of trains actually used in the game will broadly be the same as in the standard game, with one or two possible exceptions.&#10;&#10;Depending on how players want to handle things, players can choose which train in the current band they buy from the bank, or the game can be played so the trains are available in a strict order, causing possible angst or joy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pmRL7U4Qv9-9IxzgTnk0rQ__original/img/6JxaOsvFvI_hrheIUZAr-_ZCB2Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2436765.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pmRL7U4Qv9-9IxzgTnk0rQ__thumb/img/oeAnGpy3WacVSAuzBRqOYo8vfmQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2436765.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/173456","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"240","minPlayingTime":"240","maxPlayingTime":"240","bestAtCount":null}}
