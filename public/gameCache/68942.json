This pack contains 17 new cards, including &quot;Anvil&quot;, &quot;Recalculate Your XP&quot;, and the horrifying effervescence of the &quot;Soap Golem&quot; ... plus two almost-new cards. And they're balanced to let you use them as a quick rigged demo for your friends, to get them into the madness that is Munchkin!&#10;&#10;The two &quot;almost-new&quot; cards are the corrected reprints of &quot;Curse! Lead Paint!&quot; and &quot;Curse! Warranty Expires!&quot;. These were originally released with Munchkin 7: More Good Cards, but were erroneously printed with Treasure backs instead of Door backs.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jE4Zq2F8IXygH11gN_NCYQ__original/img/p_iuZ8c8Bzs6NNLgg6e3-YkfD2k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2600704.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jE4Zq2F8IXygH11gN_NCYQ__thumb/img/7WJZVpjkPzYsg6Hy6e-fyiLTA8Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2600704.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/68942","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
