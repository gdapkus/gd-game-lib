Play your cards right and become the ultimate ruler of this microcosm!&#10;&#10;Eminent Domain: Microcosm is a quick-playing two-player card game which brings you all the thrill of building a space empire in just 15-20 minutes. Each turn you take a card into your hand from the supply, then you either play a card and carry out its instructions, or pick up your discard pile to refill your hand. Each card also has a scoring condition on it, and to win you'll want to maximize those conditions.&#10;&#10;As in the grandfather game Eminent Domain, actions you take can be &quot;boosted&quot; by revealing other cards sharing the same icon. Colonize and attack planets, do research, and take advantage of politics to score the most influence by the end of the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pe5QFBAFaY_kLtHxvnpsAA__original/img/x2VclbZPSJiK1pEwZOV21Va9Fvs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2521236.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pe5QFBAFaY_kLtHxvnpsAA__thumb/img/008IYuk9u716bCjtOCK8bgcXMc4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2521236.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/163640","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.3285","averageWeight":"1.9753","boardGameRank":"3847","mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Open Drafting"],"categories":["Card Game","Civilization","Print & Play","Science Fiction","Space Exploration"],"designers":["Seth Jaffee"]}}
