The more you get, the more Spirits you will be able to get points from.&#10;&#10;Moonlight tiles - This is a new type of tile that will be included in selected scenarios and in the multiplayer variant of Moonlight. Its rules will change depending on the scenario you are playing.&#10;&#10;Moonlight cards - Moonlight cards act as missions to accomplish. These cards show four spirits of which you need a majority in order to avoid losing 6 points for each unfulfilled spirit.&#10;Ties won&rsquo;t be considered as a majority.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/btio0U4hc-jKhhTKuW_yNg__original/img/qxFo7swBy7rQUbbfwZsJWhom_eU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5491129.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/btio0U4hc-jKhhTKuW_yNg__thumb/img/dz0QL_fLYJXUEW4nI_UuTaWgPSU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5491129.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/312760","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.14675","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Pierpaolo Paoletti","Michael Schacht"]}}
