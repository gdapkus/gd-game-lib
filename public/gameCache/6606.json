Created by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic... Munchkin 3 - Clerical Errors has 112 more cards for the best-selling game of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Play a new race: Gnomes! Try on the Bard class. Face the Tequila Mockingbird, the Bad Ass, and the dreaded Auntie Paladin! Equip yourself with amazing items like the Chainmail Bikini and the Stab-A-Matic... and show them who's the mightiest, munchkinest dungeon delver of them all.&#10;&#10;And this set has a special treat. We asked five of our favorite Comic Guys to do one card each. So in this set you'll find:&#10;&#10;     Phil Foglio&#039;s Magnificent Hat&#10;     Pete Abrams&#039; Perfectly Ordinary Rabbit&#10;     Tom Ricket&#039;s Stick Figure&#10;     Jon Rosenberg&#039;s Fowl Fiend&#10;     and Randy Milholland&#039;s Redneck Tree!&#10;&#10;&#10;Munchkin 3 - Clerical Errors is a supplement to Munchkin; you will need the original game to play. Or you could add it to a game of Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, or Munchkin Bites! instead, or mix them all together for a Munchkin-fest of truly mind-bending proportions!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CQpxHBk-1l3mEwM7x6e_pA__original/img/PBrjXjRw36-nCPDg6zbRL7GNz1w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2428681.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CQpxHBk-1l3mEwM7x6e_pA__thumb/img/lGx0Q9DfSgD83D4rCL416FAz5MI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2428681.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/6606","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"4"}}
