The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra's minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Collin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith.

Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra's weakness and defeat her.&#10;&#10;Mice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom.
