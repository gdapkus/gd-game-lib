You're close &mdash; soon the whole world will know the truth behind the Cryptid. A group of like-minded cryptozoologists have come together to finally uncover the elusive creature, but the glory of discovery is too rich to share. Without giving away some of what you know you will never succeed in locating the beast, but reveal too much and your name will be long forgotten!&#10;&#10;Cryptid is a unique deduction game of honest misdirection in which players must try to uncover information about their opponents' clues while throwing them off the scent of their own. Each player holds one piece of evidence to help them find the creature, and on their turn they can try to gain more information from their opponents. Be warned; give too much away and your opponents might beat you to the mysterious animal and claim the glory for themselves!&#10;&#10;The game includes a modular board, five clue books, and a deck of set-up cards with hundreds of possible set-ups across two difficulty levels. It is also supported by an entirely optional digital companion, allowing for faster game set-up and a near-infinite range of puzzles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: some copies have a delta clue booklet with misprints in eight clues:&#10;&#10;    2,#9,#13,#64 states cougar, should be bear&#10;    3,#63,#72,#95 states bear, should be cougar&#10;&#10;&#10;The official website with an online tool to randomly generate more clues is http://playcryptid.com/&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__original/img/QenUCVaFRry4-wlimHmeLn226Bo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4037705.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__thumb/img/ZFL0o-lhnuWE21Sa9YS8qi8ayGU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4037705.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/246784","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.44047","averageWeight":"2.2715","boardGameRank":"311","mechanics":["Deduction","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Pattern Recognition"],"categories":["Deduction"],"designers":["Hal Duncan","Ruth Veevers"]}}
