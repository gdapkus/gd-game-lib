You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes.&#10;&#10;In Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London.
