Their exploits and charisma made them famous, and their story has been made into books and movies. Ted Hinton was the FBI agent charged with capturing them.&#10;&#10;You are an FBI agent competing against other agents to see who can catch Bonnie and Clyde. The object of the game is to be the first to score 100 or more points.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards used in this game: Evidence (Location) cards and the Ted Hinton card. The game is played like the classic Rummy card game, with players playing melds and layoffs of Evidence cards to score points. The Ted Hinton card adds a strategic element to the game not found in traditional Rummy. After each hand, you total your points, and if no one has 100 or more points, you play another hand.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96Sl7q5_gBDQBus-HPfQTw__original/img/fZDzZG_ZSi_XzTyMIBE9dCcx5bo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic426561.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96Sl7q5_gBDQBus-HPfQTw__thumb/img/5-VuRCfBLZcNIzM7MhvVUPn2YPY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic426561.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/16320","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.25264","averageWeight":"1.64","boardGameRank":"6306","mechanics":["Hand Management","Melding and Splaying","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game"],"designers":["Mike Fitzgerald"]}}
