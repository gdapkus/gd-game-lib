The war-weary militaries of all four empires joined together as one and sent massive fleets of capital ships and escorts to the beleaguered frontier worlds at faster-than-light (FTL) speeds.&#10;&#10;Astra Titanus is a solitaire game of space opera battles featuring fleets of highly advanced military starships that are dwarfed by a single alien robotic ship - a STAR TITAN.&#10;&#10;The Titan is controlled by cards that determine movement, special weapon use and targeting priorities. The human ships &ldquo;jump&rdquo; across space using FTL drives. There are energy beams that shatter small moons and missiles that accelerate to a substantial fraction of c, the speed of light.&#10;&#10;As Admiral, you must send your sailors out into the void against the overwhelming might of the Astra Titanus!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Minute turns; one spaceship per counter.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; map&#10;&bull; Four 8&frac12;&rdquo; x 5&frac12;&rdquo; status boards&#10;&bull; 20 Titan control cards&#10;&bull; 40 5/8&rdquo; square, two-sided unit counters&#10;&bull; 28 5/8&rdquo; round markers&#10;&bull; 20 1/2&rdquo; square, two-sided missile counters&#10;&bull; One 6-page full-color rules booklet with examples of play&#10;&bull; One 4-page full-color scenario booklet&#10;&bull; Polybag packaging and component storage&#10;&#10;Astra Titanus FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FfO5-qgnC3tbMhawNTpkAA__original/img/xVsJm1Ar_7HhwtipSCCg6um5-Lc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic865133.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FfO5-qgnC3tbMhawNTpkAA__thumb/img/rAERQqAlo83ifAcEXuAGVNq7ulM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic865133.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/88406","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.1998","averageWeight":"2.1111","boardGameRank":"6421","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Movement Points","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Science Fiction","Wargame"],"designers":["Chris Taylor (I)"]}}
