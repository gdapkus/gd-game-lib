This game could theoretically be played as it is, but the components needed to play are contained in the base-game.&#10;&#10;As in Dixit, each round, one player takes on the role of Storyteller who chooses one card from his hand, tells, sings or does something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Other players choose their own cards. Then cards are shuffled and revealed, and players vote which card was played by Storyteller, and score points according to their guesses.&#10;&#10;Player who has the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZR-ItLX9FNMuCi-j0EwUng__original/img/M4qhZm4xdVl8rdyL6OOxHMFn-fM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1632141.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZR-ItLX9FNMuCi-j0EwUng__thumb/img/DNE9d_TrCFNQujzoeSTQM8c9grk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1632141.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/55660","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[5,6],"averageRating":"7.66979","averageWeight":"1.2199","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Simultaneous Action Selection","Storytelling","Voting"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction","Humor","Party Game"],"designers":["Jean-Louis Roubira"]}}
