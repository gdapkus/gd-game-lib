Players collect stock certificates and make the companies more valuable by laying the rail network.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between stock rounds and operating rounds. In stock rounds, the cards played become shares for the players. In operating rounds, the cards played become track for the companies. The companies get trains, which determine how many track cards they can count for their profit (the trains have costs as well, which may lead to companies not making any profit at all) and in the end, players simply count the value of their shares and highest value wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HfkGSKD3ZxWMoXuPL09OUg__original/img/gocoGilYTURvZZqlZYPIfVILgkQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3039637.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HfkGSKD3ZxWMoXuPL09OUg__thumb/img/yMZhSI3jK1GJ7ceIqxVuxMnvRVw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3039637.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/118497","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"3"}}
