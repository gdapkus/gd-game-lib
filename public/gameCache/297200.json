After your seemingly endless journey across the Dreamlands, you have made your way to the land of Leng, an icy wasteland where you believe the peak of unknown Kadath resides. All the while, a presence taunts you, gnawing at your insides&mdash;a wordless voice you cannot hear, but feel within the confines of your mind. A presence that is waiting for you.&#10;&#10;Where the Gods Dwell is Scenario 4&ndash;A of The Dream-Quest campaign. This scenario can be played on its own in Standalone Mode or combined with the other expansions in The Dream-Eaters cycle to form a larger four-part or eight-part campaign. After the events of Dark Side of the Moon, you have finally made your way to lost Kadath, where Nyarlathotep is waiting for a battle that will force you to face deceit, lies, and shifting reality. If you can somehow draw him out, expose him, you may stand a chance, but how do you fight an enemy you cannot understand?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p7lSAGw5_-I1iCtBEBWLLw__original/img/km0Yyh5Lmyjkv_yE_taObJEImNM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5873946.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p7lSAGw5_-I1iCtBEBWLLw__thumb/img/-CUEzvIMQzkQO9QL7NUW_gehNAA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5873946.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/297200","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
