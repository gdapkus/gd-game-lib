But do you think you are the one with the most points in hand?&#10;You will have to choose: stop the round immediately or give the others an extra turn to try to extend the gap? Is it worth taking the risk? &#10;The game ends when you reach 30/35/40 points (4/3/2 players).&#10;&#10;The excitement of ending the round to catch your opponents off guard&#10;&#10;The pleasure of playing your effect cards and making combos&#10;&#10;It's a set collection card game like Rummy.
