Each of the five colors includes two 'finishing cards', and these cards can be played on a stack of the matching color at any time, after which no further number cards can be added to that stack; once five finishing cards have been played, or the deck has been exhausted, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Keltis: The Card Game is based on Keltis (the board game), also known as Lost Cities: The Board Game, based on Lost Cities (the card game). But note, Keltis: The Card Game and Lost Cities are two similar but ultimately different games.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EPyNE4kIQu-hYQYmUpnlmw__original/img/NKVIQvjboE9EA7R0oQxSSNjGEoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic588210.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EPyNE4kIQu-hYQYmUpnlmw__thumb/img/PYr2JcCLcSkFsKt9CLMKEESbvgI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic588210.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/40832","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.67665","averageWeight":"1.4841","boardGameRank":"2816","mechanics":["Hand Management","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Number"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
