The Abbey tiles act as Cloisters but do not have to match adjacent tiles and they complete adjacent features when placed. Mayors can be placed only in cities, with their strength determined by the number of pennants in the city. Barns allow players to score fields during the game rather than just at the end. Wagons are placed on roads, cities, or cloisters, and can move to an adjacent open feature when their current feature is completed.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Carcassonne&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QGzPcd0qfC4VV4aQNj-Oug__original/img/ihiFoaL9iZZN90UQCf4E8cP7WI4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3513934.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QGzPcd0qfC4VV4aQNj-Oug__thumb/img/Wn2aiX1CrztygKV8w0hm10IlhtQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3513934.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/31784","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.14393","averageWeight":"2.0192","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","City Building","Medieval","Territory Building"],"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"]}}
