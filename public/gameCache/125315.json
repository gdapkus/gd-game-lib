In FlowerFall, players attempt to form large garden patches containing more of their color flower than their opponents. Each continuous patch will score points at the end of the game. Adding cards to the table is not as simple as placing them down, however. You must carefully drop them, letting them flutter through the air. Skill improves your chances, but the whim of the environment may thwart you.&#10;&#10;FlowerFall is a quick, portable game you can play anywhere. The location you're at becomes the terrain!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FmclEy8FMIx72O5-qwVh8w__original/img/joGVaspl3gCOQkmF_25DR_mlkUs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1391445.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FmclEy8FMIx72O5-qwVh8w__thumb/img/LHeYxlJml-SQnUuRoRMG_ftpO50=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1391445.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/125315","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":"4"}}
