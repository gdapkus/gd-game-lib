Lead your tribe and explore the frozen earth. Harness its resources. Recruit surface survivors to your cause. Build factories with powerful machines. And populate ancient sites to relearn your tribe's forgotten technologies.&#10;--&#10;Revive is a game for 1-4 players with asymmetric player powers, highly variable setup, and no fighting or direct conflict. Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.&#10;&#10;A main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game. The game ends when all artifacts have been taken, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn you take two actions: &#10;&#10;     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)&#10;     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)&#10;     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)&#10;     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__original/img/NxxAoxVxMNkDGEkD3aoobPL14dI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6950224.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__thumb/img/NPtXuKlsnfPORSn6kpTcf-ZdEF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6950224.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/332772","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"8.13965","averageWeight":"3.4271","boardGameRank":"99","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Map Addition","Network and Route Building","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Civilization","Industry / Manufacturing","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Helge Meissner","Kristian Amundsen Østby","Eilif Svensson","Anna Wermlund"]}}
