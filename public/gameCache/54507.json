Play as either Albrecht, Alexandra, Enzo, Nnelg or Mathilda as you race for glory through the African savannah. However, winning the race is the least of your worries.  Cheetahs will try to eat you. Crocodiles will try to eat you. Warthogs will probably try to ignore you. Elephants are just in the way. The less said about porcupines the better.&#10;&#10;The game will include 25 track sections allowing players to once again design their own races. Some of these feature &ldquo;unhelpful&rdquo; animals. Special tracks involving a rope bridge, quicksand and a sand dune are also included.&#10;&#10;A limited edition of 1,000 games will be produced for Essen 2009. The game is fast paced and easy to learn.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dj14m6YIxzB130za-tpdsA__original/img/nKpP8lkunqbsVoSv4KBzKUoulCc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic572120.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dj14m6YIxzB130za-tpdsA__thumb/img/F5eK765S6UDHLc_yQrYkfJ2dv-Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic572120.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/54507","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"5"}}
