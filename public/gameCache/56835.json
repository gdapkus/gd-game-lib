Players take turns trying to get opponents to guess a particular word, giving only a 3 word clue - and one of those words must be from a prior answer! For each clue given, each player may make 1 guess. If none are correct, the clue-giver creates another clue, using one of the guesses and up to 2 other words.&#10;&#10;When the word is correctly guessed, the guessing player and the clue giver each get one point, and the clue giver draws a new card and continues making clues. Get as many as you can in 2 minutes!&#10;&#10;Train of Thought really makes you think differently than other games in the genre. An excellent party game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WYNaM8IfHAYoy8Os7zziRw__original/img/81yayaq5BW0ds8BaRAUVs6_MMEU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic946896.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WYNaM8IfHAYoy8Os7zziRw__thumb/img/0e_Ux6GTtGZlFY3liXZRiaBn7Kk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic946896.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/56835","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4,6],"averageRating":"5.97749","averageWeight":"1.2857","boardGameRank":"10513","mechanics":[],"categories":["Party Game","Word Game"],"designers":["Jay Cormier","Sen-Foong Lim"]}}
