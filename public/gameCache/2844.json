The systems get progressively tougher as players move inward which often involves battling units of greater size and/or technology level.  The interesting mechanics allows players to choose 11 different unit types (6 space and 5 ground) to organize into fleets, explore and conquer worlds.  In addition, there are four types of technology: Space Combat, Ground Combat, Jump (controls how far a fleet may move), and Communications (controls the distance you can control fleets).  Players compete to be the first to control a certain number of systems for a full turn.  Controlling the Throneworld counts as six (6) systems.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oASaGg-UVC0Qy3YZb8sEMQ__original/img/mM6nJ0TqTGNsgv1PMeziHcbYGaw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic77647.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oASaGg-UVC0Qy3YZb8sEMQ__thumb/img/a8yAIHrRQzbZRcgLYRaEG2yMjmM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic77647.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2844","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1997","playingTime":"270","minPlayingTime":"270","maxPlayingTime":"270","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.61903","averageWeight":"3.5238","boardGameRank":"9538","mechanics":["Hexagon Grid","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Science Fiction","Space Exploration","Territory Building","Wargame"],"designers":["Thomas Lehmann"]}}
