In this micro-deckbuilding game, you have no hand at all; instead, you play cards directly from the top of your deck. Each card is double-sided, with each side granting different special bonuses. Winning the game requires delicate strategies... and some luck as well!!&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they play cards directly from the top of their deck to acquire cash and victory points. They may continue playing cards as long as they have fewer than three &quot;unhappiness&quot; icons in play. If they do get three icons, their turn ends immediately, but if they stop before then, they can use their cash to either buy a new card or flip over a card they already own, transforming it into a new, upgraded card. Upgraded cards typically grant more cash and VP as well as the option to flip them back to their non-upgraded side in exchange for an extra one-time bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player gains eight or more VP in a single turn, the player wins immediately!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmRLUZzu8RSra-ifZybRXA__original/img/lgcQbRRoBzc3azoGQNVznXu6cJc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2499620.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmRLUZzu8RSra-ifZybRXA__thumb/img/r-48b61eRGu-4mNe_76spqEP1cc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2499620.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/168679","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"50","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"50","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.28777","averageWeight":"1.7387","boardGameRank":"2953","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Push Your Luck","Sudden Death Ending"],"categories":["Card Game","City Building"],"designers":["Chih-Fan Chen"]}}
