To help them do this, one player takes the role of seer &mdash; and the seer knows more than everyone else!&#10;&#10;Each round, a specific number of cards are dealt out to players, and the seer is allowed to look at some of these cards in advance of play in order to give the team clues about these numbers on a wipeable board.&#10;&#10;After the players have placed all cards face down, the seer checks whether the cards are in the right order, thereby completing the level. If not, the team loses a life, and the seer distributes these same cards again. In addition, the seer gives another hint.&#10;&#10;If the team masters all twelve levels, they have won and can now call themselves &quot;soulmates&quot;.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuUSKJDwy01HZfTdJTUqpg__original/img/AyoGntWaeE2MobstLCTW2HgeGr4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7296951.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuUSKJDwy01HZfTdJTUqpg__thumb/img/8Tqvp7g_o0M_m7DCKxt-8UP-Vyk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7296951.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/378851","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"3"}}
