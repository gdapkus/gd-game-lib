    "description": "Neuroshima Hex! is a strategy game set in the post-apocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a Polish role-playing game. Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released at Spiel 2007, had updated graphics and a new, larger board; a special expansion pack sold at the same time included the Neuroshima Hex! Doomsday Machine 1.0, a fifth army that could be used against any of the other ones.&#10;&#10;The first French edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released in 2008, included an additional four Mercenary tiles. The first English edition from Z-Man Games that same year includes the Mercenary tiles and the Mad Bomber tile.&#10;&#10;Neuroshima Hex! 3.0, released in 2013 from Z-Man Games, includes rule corrections, the Doomsday Machine army (for five armies in the NH base game), a solo variant with 55 puzzle cards that present you with challenging situations, and new three-player variants: Deathmatch; Deathmatch with scores; one player vs. a team; and a team match (with one player playing two armies).&#10;&#10; The game is also expanded by Unofficial Neuroshima Hex! expansions, available here on BGG.&#10;&#10;Note:  All base game and expansion armies in all versions/editions are functionally compatible!  The only differences between armies from e.g. 3.0 and 2.5 (or whatever) are art &amp; graphic design.&#10;&#10;Note:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against.  The only options for &quot;solo&quot; play are soloing multiple factions yourself, or solving puzzles (like Chess checkmate problems) available in some editions and expansions.&#10;&#10;",
