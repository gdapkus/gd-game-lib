Old-continent quarrels become new again in the colonies. At times, precarious moments of peace are maintained &mdash; until wars erupt again. Human greed is an eternal source of conflicts...&#10;&#10;Archipelago: War &amp; Peace introduces forty new beautifully- and individually-illustrated evolution cards: twenty character and twenty progress cards. These cards &mdash; which can be combined with the base game or used as a complete replacement &mdash; are more aggressive, interactive and (sometimes) drastic than the original ones, covering the major themes of war, peace, and trade, among others.&#10;&#10;With Archipelago: War &amp; Peace, you can add spice to your games and make Archipelago new again!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     40 Cards&#10;     1 Card Tray (fits up to 90 sleeved evolution cards)&#10;     1 Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P2MIu0L1DQ7WAV4FqDvCDw__original/img/ETaQyB8KzRFa_MCM5zdjCFJe19o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1926005.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P2MIu0L1DQ7WAV4FqDvCDw__thumb/img/QYRX1Wd1RAu70rmv8Oqz7W9q5zE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1926005.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/154863","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"240","minPlayingTime":"240","maxPlayingTime":"240","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.7527","averageWeight":"3.1304","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Commodity Speculation","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Tile Placement","Trading","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Civilization","Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Exploration","Nautical","Negotiation","Renaissance"],"designers":["Christophe Boelinger"]}}
