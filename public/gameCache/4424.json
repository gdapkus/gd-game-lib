    "description": "A timed version of Cranium, designed for two or more players to play cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 4 cards depicting commonly known people, places, or objects. Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;The four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:&#10;&#10;    Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodling&#10;    Tongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letter&#10;    Soundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)&#10;    Tweener - give hints in the form &quot;It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank&quot;, using two objects that imply the answer&#10;&#10;&#10;After someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile. The next player takes the die and repeats the same process, until either no cards are left or the available 15 minutes are gone.&#10;&#10;Players who are stuck on a particular card can choose to discard that card, but two new cards must then be added to the game instead - one card is placed directly in that player's hand, and a penalty card is added to the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;The game is won by all players if they can work together to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out.&#10;&#10;",
