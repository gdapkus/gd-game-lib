Accept the challenge against all others to conquer the Fortress!&#10;&#10;FORTRESS is a game about taking risks and out-witting and bluffing your friends to become the dominant ruler of the kingdom.&#10;&#10;You start a Fast Forward game without reading a rules booklet in advance! Just grab some fellow gamers and discover the rules while playing. The Fast Forward series uses the Fable Game system introduced in Fabled Fruit: With the presorted deck of cards, you will discover all cards and rules as you play. It will take twelve games of FORTRESS before your group has explored the entire system. It can then be reset and played again by the same or different groups!&#10;&#10;FORTRESS is the second of four completely different games in the Fast Forward Series!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U7zSrxHYKBlvxOv7hJnJvA__original/img/Ns-eTfbrQaIWeaLfcNMlxLylEvg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3652008.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U7zSrxHYKBlvxOv7hJnJvA__thumb/img/zr537KFckW8S1L-sNLBk95WAiPo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3652008.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/231665","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":"4"}}
