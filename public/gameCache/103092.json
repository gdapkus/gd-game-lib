But life isn't only about work. Your village baker longs for a partner, and the farmer's son has his eye on the dashing woodcutter in the neighboring village.&#10;&#10;So let the wedding bells ring and marry off that farmer's son in the village of another player, thereby earning you additional income. And surely your village baker will find a woman from a neighboring village to move in with him. Before you know it, their offspring will be new citizens in your village.&#10;&#10;Your goal in Helvetia is to build new homes, bring culture to your village, and sell essential goods at market. Whatever strategy you choose, this village life won't be boring &ndash; especially in the villages that grow and thrive!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LS2BJeVoLAzx7HQGPeaIuQ__original/img/4xa2koO4jRvUTh8KwEWct4ce660=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1043543.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LS2BJeVoLAzx7HQGPeaIuQ__thumb/img/dXX_e8NSJlTizPQ6BQveGg5SxxY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1043543.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/103092","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.96997","averageWeight":"3.0548","boardGameRank":"1960","mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"categories":["City Building"],"designers":["Matthias Cramer"]}}
