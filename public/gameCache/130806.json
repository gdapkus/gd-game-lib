The Corps each receive a new agenda and flavorful piece of ice while the Runners launch into the ongoing cyberstruggles with new icebreakers and support cards. Additionally, the Anarch and Haas-Bioroid factions each pursue new interests with a new identity card, and the new Anarch identity &ndash; Whizzard &ndash; provides Anarch players a whole depth of new strategies based around trashing the cards they access.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4ZEnXAQdX_xEAYMt70Skrw__original/img/ihQAAXPYm0HS09aRGPwQY4HWrPQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534826.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4ZEnXAQdX_xEAYMt70Skrw__thumb/img/xHYpW3o7vPUnKSinU686_apcQ-M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1534826.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/130806","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
