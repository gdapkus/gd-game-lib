Compete to build the best sea-faring nation with up to three friends by collecting treasure, hiring crew, and conquering or befriending island towns.&#10;&#10;In Islebound, you take command of a ship and crew.  You sail to island towns, collecting resources, hiring crew, and commissioning buildings for your capital city.  Each building has a unique ability, and your combination of buildings can greatly enhance your strength as a trader, builder, or invader.  You also recruit pirates and sea monsters to conquer towns, which, once conquered, allow you to complete the town action for free, and charge a fee to opponents if they want to use it.  Alternatively, you can complete events that give influence, which can be used to befriend towns.&#10;&#10;There are many routes to success.  Will you be a ruthless conqueror, careful diplomat, or shrewd merchant in your race to the top?&#10;&#10;The player with the most wealth and most-impressive capital city will win the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ccTWaeqW_LhEBfw8F1Vs4A__original/img/tS5RZm9iA-KMJTTUEpkQcLNsH20=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2812825.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ccTWaeqW_LhEBfw8F1Vs4A__thumb/img/St0c2nhNg66oAOQFD3xHE5Ox4vo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2812825.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/185589","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"7.1619","averageWeight":"2.7253","boardGameRank":"1151","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Modular Board","Ownership","Pick-up and Deliver","Push Your Luck","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Fantasy","Nautical","Pirates"],"designers":["Ryan Laukat"]}}
