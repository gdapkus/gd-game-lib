It comes with a new board, 46 new destination cards and a set of rules (in several languages) to create a new game. The Ticket to Ride: Switzerland map and rules first appeared as an exclusive map for the Ticket to Ride computer game. In addition to being specifically designed for a smaller numbers of players the map has several new features. Locomotive cards are used exclusively for tunnels (which work as they do in Ticket to Ride: Europe). Some destination cards have an end point inside Switzerland and other possible ends in adjacent countries (the value of the completed card is based on the farthest possible connection completed). There are also destination cards for connections between adjacent countries.&#10;&#10;Although not officially sanctioned, it works fine with Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries also. Due to Ticket to Ride: M&#195;&#164;rklin's different distribution of train cards, Ticket to Ride: Switzerland is not considered to be compatible.&#10;&#10;Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented / Re-printed in:&#10;&#10;    Ticket to Ride Map Collection 2: India & Switzerland&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NGuzKhH_fRZkUlT11Sef7Q__original/img/xcJxl3clJmjVDKhXy1qZNT-OpQs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic620078.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NGuzKhH_fRZkUlT11Sef7Q__thumb/img/oUHv4vSWjSJYgb9vCh7-kEId1v0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic620078.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/30746","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"3","yearPublished":"2007","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
