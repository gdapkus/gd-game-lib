The systems previously thought to be empty are suddenly swarming with Ancients &ndash; whole worlds of them, with ship capabilities way beyond anything seen before.&#10;&#10;They are not willing to negotiate.&#10;&#10;Eclipse: Rise of the Ancients, the first full-size expansion for Eclipse, introduces several new additions to the base game, such as Rare Technologies, Developments, Alliances, Ancient Homeworlds and Warp Portals. There are also three new player boards with four new different alien species to choose from. New components allow up to nine players in one session.&#10;&#10;Due to the modular design, you can use all of these additions or just some of them in any game of Eclipse, according to your preferences and play style.&#10;&#10;The Ancients are rising.
