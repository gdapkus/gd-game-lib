The basic principle of the Spiel des Jahres 2023 is retained, but now both sides continue to expand their own landscape with the tile they have just revealed. Two new types of assignments also come into play with double and all-around assignments, which can also be combined with Dorfromantik: The Board Game. Two independently playable modules also provide more challenge, more variety, more interaction. Four of the new special tiles can also be integrated into Dorfromantik: The Board Game and played cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Dorfromantik: The Duel allows two players or two teams to compete. And with two copies even up to four people can play. Who will create the most beautiful world of hexagonal landscapes? Who will be better at fulfilling the villager's orders while also mastering the challenge of new assignments?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qh4nFe79pOwSbRYpmOHswg__original/img/WKZ8oGySFzsKgyFU1BHUAfI2taA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7898487.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qh4nFe79pOwSbRYpmOHswg__thumb/img/llCy8WL4PZaWmWs5l3kKmeGIqMU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7898487.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/395364","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.14203","averageWeight":"1.8182","boardGameRank":"5670","mechanics":["Hexagon Grid","Modular Board"],"categories":["City Building","Environmental","Puzzle"],"designers":["Michael Palm","Lukas Zach"]}}
