    "description": "Revealing the terrible artist in all of us, players in Scrawl start off with a loaded phrase, doodle it, then pass it on. By the time your masterpiece of an \"OAP Conga Line\" passes through your friends' weird minds and wonky pens &mdash; and makes it back to you &mdash; things will have gone horribly wrong. Points are awarded for the most disastrous doodles and godawful guesses. Most grins wins.\n\n(Commercial reimplementation of the folk game Eat Poop You Cat.)\n\n",
