The players (leaders of a royal Egyptian family) choose their sites, build their pyramids, and thank Amun-Re and the other gods for their bounty.&#10;&#10;In Amun-Re, each pharaoh wants to build the most pyramids. To accomplish this, they must first acquire a province where they can trade and farm. With their profits, they can buy new provinces and building-stones to erect pyramids. For all their actions players must make clever use of their power cards, and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun-Re.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wFD0mXh1AZshtsYlrBXyzA__original/img/TbMBl_wTToaiNN9YIF4nixlM6SE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2748305.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wFD0mXh1AZshtsYlrBXyzA__thumb/img/nLzU6sEdEIrWcjgBVOlj-Jfsl6s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2748305.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5404","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"7.28981","averageWeight":"3.0308","boardGameRank":"535","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Auction: Fixed Placement","Constrained Bidding","Score-and-Reset Game"],"categories":["Ancient","Economic"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
