In a clever twist, dice are used as resources, with each side/number representing a different resource. Some resources are stable, allowing them to be stored between turns, while others must be used right away. Buildings provide new capabilities, such as increased production, resource manipulation, and additional victory points. Using dice-as-resources facilitates a dynamic, ever-changing resources management mini-game while players work to earn victory points by adding building to their tableau on their way to victory.&#10;&#10;Colony includes 28 different building card types, of which only seven are used each game in addition to the fixed buildings that are used each time that you play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tcf2t0SyKPNr0GIr7AdAfA__original/img/kmmUtMgZX7r5XOgYLgttYHT3Ask=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2921730.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tcf2t0SyKPNr0GIr7AdAfA__thumb/img/QjHGGU2AQxjhdbGNT5-gVhm7aKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2921730.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/192934","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
