A sled below this speed takes 1 dent card for each point of speed below 5.&#10;Furthermore, if a sled ends its movement on a crevasse square, the player doesn&acute;t refill his hand (as if colliding with another sled).&#10;&#10;Of course, the effects described above can be cumulative.&#10;Example: a player whose sled passes the purple line at speed 3 and ends its move on the crevasse takes 2 dent cards and doesn&acute;t refill his hand. Best of luck for the rest of the race!&#10;&#10;Enjoy the leap of death...&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u9IENt1mlP22JKW-bIAirg__original/img/Fy2EgR7T2lo4pSo6rKE6m1EdB9o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic573850.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u9IENt1mlP22JKW-bIAirg__thumb/img/0hr-E00tXsPwjZWbqoPpCFvx2YM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic573850.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/42971","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
