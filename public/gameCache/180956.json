Fortunately, the village has several residents with special powers, with most willing to help eliminate this fanged menace!&#10;&#10;One Night Ultimate Vampire is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: The nefarious Vampire, the well-meaning Cupid, the sneaky Assassin, or others, each with a special ability. In the course of a single evening, your village will decide who among them is a vampire...because all it takes is finding one vampire to win!&#10;&#10;One Night Ultimate Vampire can be combined with One Night Ultimate Werewolf or One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak or both games.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQUo9__DzqLpb4WldWMw0g__original/img/twJfMEHvgLKihXGkeoOEjjwDVy8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2604284.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQUo9__DzqLpb4WldWMw0g__thumb/img/RODG7e-Z3_SfoEH1l8BS69WqMnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2604284.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/180956","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"10","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":[6,7],"averageRating":"6.65391","averageWeight":"1.58","boardGameRank":"2654","mechanics":["Hidden Roles","Role Playing","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Traitor Game","Variable Player Powers","Voting"],"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction","Horror","Party Game"],"designers":["Ted Alspach","Akihisa Okui"]}}
