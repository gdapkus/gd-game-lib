The tile (only) will be published in Q2 2018 exclusively through the BoardGameGeek store.&#10;&#10;The rules for the Sorcerer tile are as follows:&#10;&#10;When a player places worker(s) on the sorcerer tile, they take the action on any one of the adjacent tiles in the owner's village. If the sorcerer has been upgraded, then they take the action of any one other tile in the owner's village. Workers cannot be placed on the sorcerer tile whilst it is being bid for, as the sorcerer tile is not adjacent to any other tile and the placement would therefore have no effect.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cflkVtFHBrnmz9vmbRlPWQ__original/img/d0Nmj7RPdDwc_cOX-R6rr4V1oFw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3947735.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cflkVtFHBrnmz9vmbRlPWQ__thumb/img/REO6a95OmO-aoSFRC2iaBqb-ghE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3947735.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/245170","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
