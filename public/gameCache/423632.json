These so-called &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; are now implementing policies and creating optimal investment conditions for international players to enter their economies and achieve impressive economic growth.&#10;&#10;In Asian Tigers: A Story of Prosperity, you are an investor sponsored by each of the Asian Tigers, and your goal is to help these markets flourish and achieve much-desired success. You will build power plants, research laboratories, sponsor universities, and establish factories that will produce resources with the purpose of serving local and, more importantly, international markets.&#10;&#10;An easy-going mechanism provides an interactive experience in which players dispute the relevance of their presence in each of the Tigers and also the personal goals established by their own management decisions. Producing resources such as ships, machinery, automobiles, chemicals, finance, and electronics is the way to serve the global markets to succeed.&#10;&#10;The economic revolution in Asia has started, and you are a part of it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YxNBXiFJYxLk55NUylpvyg__original/img/yelcOu4Cuv5Rfu3V8zII9fuygaM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8272764.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YxNBXiFJYxLk55NUylpvyg__thumb/img/JvYD38kVtQmvub8FI_Ei2Lw6A_8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8272764.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/423632","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2024","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[2,4],"averageRating":"7.2036","averageWeight":"3.6667","boardGameRank":"8691","mechanics":["Variable Phase Order","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Economic","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro","Paulo Soledade"]}}
