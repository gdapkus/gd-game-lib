It's an expansion for the original deduction game Mr. Jack developed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc.&#10;&#10;You can opt to move the carriage/coach instead of activating a character.  Its effect is to pick up a character, and zip the suspect up to 8 spaces away, and deposit him/her at the other end of the journey.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Mr. Jack&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3S7rGve3pVLKuSKT8nIk2Q__original/img/vK6isah5J35duqaj15i-x1fimPs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2403985.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3S7rGve3pVLKuSKT8nIk2Q__thumb/img/Uy-Cu38CqhPg9eT7Hdfk6b2CP70=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2403985.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/30941","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.4341","averageWeight":"1.7778","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Grid Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Deduction","Expansion for Base-game","Murder / Mystery"],"designers":["Bruno Cathala","Ludovic Maublanc"]}}
