In addition they contain new spots for your workers to score any two of your mango villages again (scaled like the markets for player number).&#10;Finally there is a new brown yield tile for the Navaratnas variant which gives you 3$ for each mango village in your province.&#10;You can't overbuild Mango villages via Master Builder, but you can use Master Builder with the normal 5 and another 5 to build the Mango village over other province tiles.&#10;&#10;Rules are in English and German but tiles are language neutral.&#10;Rules in French and Dutch are available online.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xsei-4ZkURT-HLOWK4wRdQ__original/img/po8BjkxI1zepQ2QEbSbgfRynN-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3805062.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xsei-4ZkURT-HLOWK4wRdQ__thumb/img/lcLpoMKZh-1vQuCq-gutlcaVxQI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3805062.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/234158","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.60892","averageWeight":"2.75","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Territory Building"],"designers":["Markus Brand","Inka Brand"]}}
