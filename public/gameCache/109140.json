The Bishop's Favor can also be referenced as Module 11.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, these tiles are placed face-down, randomized and placed one per fresco tile on the game board. Whenever a player completes a fresco tile where the bishop is currently located, the player claims both the fresco tile and the favor tile &ndash; which is revealed and grants an immediate reward of paint (red, blue, yellow), money (1 or 5), one VP, or one mood improvement.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a fresco tile where the bishop is not located, the favor tile is removed from the game face-down with no benefit for anyone.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cNE8f4iLVZCK7TWXfRwVig__original/img/ZYpCHQnPmU_b3Yl6DmCi5fhqcxw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1102403.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cNE8f4iLVZCK7TWXfRwVig__thumb/img/Z-3CY3g6mPvzJbu2CfjYrVIkjKg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1102403.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/109140","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
