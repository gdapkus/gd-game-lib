You leapt through, finding yourself standing on a network of purplestone archways, rising from a vast, gray sea. Now, you pull out your level and compass and begin what surely is the greatest challenge of your career as a royal cartographer.&#10;&#10;Cartographers: Map Pack 2, Affril can be played with either Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale or Cartographers Heroes.&#10;&#10;It includes 75 double-sided new map sheets featuring six islands and 3 new scoring cards, specifically for use with this map pack. Players pick two starting islands and may only draw on those islands to start with, before spending coins to branch out to other islands as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7b-bqQ4DCvhFgxLV34tA5g__original/img/Y1CCtkuAeFHcDiPEg9Nd3ovYQrw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5648476.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7b-bqQ4DCvhFgxLV34tA5g__thumb/img/UP7Rr_RglvfH1RCBSYW4ruJ9Eb4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5648476.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/319273","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"75","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null}}
