In a desperate bid for survival, the rebels outfit an asteroid with heavy weapons -- including the secret gravity warper -- and send it on an earth-grazing orbit.  The Terran fleet comes out to do battle with Star Fist.&#10;&#10;From the Designer:&#10;&#10;This is an intermediate-level game...not exactly beer-and-pretzels, but not difficult.  It's definitely tactical rather than strategic; the best-laid plans can fall apart very quickly when your foe gets a lucky hit on a vital system.&#10;&#10;Movement system based on Triplanetary, by Marc Miller&#10;Cover by Alan Gutierrez; back cover by Ruth Thompson&#10;Map and counter graphics by Carl Anderson and Manuel Garcia&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w_78lyS8-J4d6psv2hfiMQ__original/img/V8VMrpxzWzsmvbHRrwMdsFTnhMQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic208687.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w_78lyS8-J4d6psv2hfiMQ__thumb/img/5hhbJRYgUAAUMHoN8PMTYrL95fQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic208687.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2845","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1991","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"5.2478","averageWeight":"1.8333","boardGameRank":"23850","mechanics":["Hexagon Grid"],"categories":["Science Fiction","Wargame"],"designers":["Steve Jackson (I)"]}}
