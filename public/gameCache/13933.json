Camelot gleams under the rule of King Arthur. On his orders, knights travel through the land to bring peace and experience adventures. To fill their assignments and be successful at tournaments, the knights must constantly improve their bravery, strength, dexterity and wisdom. Because successful deeds are rewarded by the king. Who will free the beautiful maiden or best the Black Knight?&quot;&#10;&#10;This plays like a board game, but the destinations are mapped out by placement of cards.&#10;The entire game fits in a small Adlung-Spiele card deck box.  The instructions are printed in very small type on very thin paper, and the English translation is not the best.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QSJLwKsQbmlKlsxhIq6Y8w__original/img/Neg8VMESH7McClPo72m8kLAHbvU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic296557.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QSJLwKsQbmlKlsxhIq6Y8w__thumb/img/lM0a72vC9Rz6E_wK10n9nhW0Bsc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic296557.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/13933","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
