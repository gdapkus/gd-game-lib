    "description": "Cinch is a member of the All Fours family of bidding/trick-taking games, of which it is one of the more sophisticated.  The object is to win the high, low, jack and ten of trumps (each worth one point each) and the five of trumps and the five of the suit which is the same color as trumps (each worth five points).  Although once played widely, it is now apparently popular only in certain regions of the US, especially Louisiana. A variant called Pidro is played a lot by Swedish-speaking Finns in/from the Ostrobothnia region of Finland.\n\n",
