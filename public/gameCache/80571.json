Now they're back as a new booster pack: Munchkin Reloaded!&#10;&#10;All your favorite cards have returned: the Race modifiers &quot;Dark&quot; and &quot;High&quot;, the class modifier &quot;Master&quot;, and of course the Reloaded Die (and we threw in an extra one, too!). This set also features the classic card &quot;Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies&quot; from the virtual pages of Randy Milholland's hit webcomic Something*Positive. And of course, all the art is now in full color!&#10;&#10;This is an expansion for Munchkin, not a stand-alone set. Munchkin Reloaded! is not collectible or randomized; every pack is the same as every other.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7rCeyARowlllpF_aA6P6Sg__original/img/qrllFC4BRnrLn93ujL031SHRzWU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic813486.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7rCeyARowlllpF_aA6P6Sg__thumb/img/KRRsz-K4eBW2FtkaAFxnKRwXars=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic813486.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/80571","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.64774","averageWeight":"2.3077","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Trading","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Fighting","Humor"],"designers":["Steve Jackson (I)"]}}
