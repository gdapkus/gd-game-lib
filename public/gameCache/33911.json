    "description": "From the publisher:\n\n\"It is 37 AD and Caligula is the extravagant Emperor of Rome! It is a time of excesses. It is a time of intrigue. And the latest gala in Caligula&rsquo;s short reign is starting tonight&mdash;Bacchus&rsquo; Banquet!\"\n\nFrom BoardgameNews.com:\n\n\"As a player, you are one of the nine &ldquo;honored&rdquo; guests&mdash;each with his or her own secret objective. You might be a glutton who is only there for the food and wine. You might be an avaricious opportunist longing for the presents that are often bestowed. You might be a conspirator in one of the many plots to kidnap or assassinate the Emperor. You might even be Caligula himself, exploiting the all-too-human foibles of his groveling subjects.\"\n\n",
