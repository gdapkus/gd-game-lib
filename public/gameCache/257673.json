Art has been revolutionized by the invention of &quot;perspective,&quot; and also of &quot;funding.&quot; A picture used to be worth a dozen or so words; these new ones are more like a hundred. Oil paintings have gotten so realistic that you've hired an artist to do a portrait of you each morning, so you can make sure your hair is good. Busts have gotten better too; no more stopping at the shoulders, they go all the way to the ground. Science and medicine have advanced; there's no more superstition, now they know the perfect number of leeches to apply for each ailment. You have a clock accurate to within an hour, and a calendar accurate to within a week. Your physician heals himself, and your barber cuts his own hair. This is truly a golden age.&#10;&#10;This is the 12th expansion to Dominion. It has 300 cards, with 25 new Kingdom cards. There are tokens that let you save coins and actions for later, Projects that grant abilities, and Artifacts to fight over.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8eKS09rQjkuuKHtzPmVhA__original/img/kuDm8id1XPxAKTK_oWf-0j2kwQc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4250088.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8eKS09rQjkuuKHtzPmVhA__thumb/img/b7mi_GATaLtDx3j53bBq6zH3c4k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4250088.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/257673","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
