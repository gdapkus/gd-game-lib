The lilies of the lake only open their blossoms in the rain, and only rarely do all eight kinds of lily bloom at once. The goal of A Gentle Rain is to place the lake tiles in such a way to cause all eight types of lilies to bloom before you run out of tiles and the rain ends.&#10;&#10;Place each new tile you draw next to a tile already in play, making sure to match the colors of all the tile edges touching the tile you are placing. Each time you manage to complete a square of four touching tiles, a blossom opens between them.&#10;&#10;Keep Score, or don&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EqqXUmjIuGspHNwt1UnDEQ__original/img/zROVukvZZ-GZR2Rm8JfzLOzGKnE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7769466.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EqqXUmjIuGspHNwt1UnDEQ__thumb/img/qKGfLe9Y83j2-UEzfRy1bIbNosI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7769466.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/334011","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.66483","averageWeight":"1.1458","boardGameRank":"2032","mechanics":["Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Puzzle"],"designers":["Kevin Wilson"]}}
