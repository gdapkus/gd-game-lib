A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play, adding lots of replay-ability. Fast Paced Game Play with Easy To Learn rules allows players to jump right into the action, while Strategic Depth and Strong Cooperative Play keeps the game interesting.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJMKi_NZtaQXH6y6SgcFNg__original/img/rzfi36y8qO1SjmWRQ1A-o4bUJqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic277321.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJMKi_NZtaQXH6y6SgcFNg__thumb/img/ICEvAgEkDc-c4nH5YkP-Yb_2HsQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic277321.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/32248","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"5"}}
