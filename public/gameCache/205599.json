Is it like a river? Or maybe an ocean? Is it like up, but sideways? Is it churning chaos, background noise, held together only briefly by our own awareness of it? You don't know.

It's a simple process of weeding through the alternatives, snipping prudently &mdash; an ungrateful utopia here, a useless revolution there. In the end, from the Age of Atlantis to the Zombie Apocalypse, the eras will sing your praise.&#10;&#10;Temporum: Alternate Realities, an expansion for Temporum, adds 48 more Zones and 60 more Player cards, plus chits and cards used by the new Zones.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2UjSvT865LaIZv18EqLzBw__original/img/OTzHZ2Xgvs1thNO1Ho7ct8p9lWE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3121246.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2UjSvT865LaIZv18EqLzBw__thumb/img/4CY032xKvwfb1u7ZaXXdZhbejlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3121246.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/205599","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
