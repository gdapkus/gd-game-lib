    "description": "Alone, you enter the ossuary. Your head bows instinctively before the Crown of Bones, a formidable relic of enduring construction. But that&rsquo;s not all this hall holds. Altars, sconces, crucifixes: some of the most symbolic and resonant icons of bone occupy the room. You must find a way to replicate them all in order to consider yourself a true master. \n\nCrown of Bones builds on the solo play mode found in Monstrance, introducing 6 new Features to construct as well as 6 new scoring patterns to incorporate. Players will choose 1 of each randomly at setup to guide their gameplay. Crown of Bones is playable without Monstrance but the scoring condition side of the cards will require the skulls from the expansions. If you think you&rsquo;ve mastered Skulls of Sedlec, step forward and claim your Crown.\n\n\nSkulls of Sedlec: Crown of Bones is a 6-card expansion for Skulls of Sedlec, allowing for solo play.\n\nThis solo expansion celebrates these works of art by allowing you to create six unique features alongside a standard, pyramid-shaped stack of skulls. Each play session adds a condition that will make this undertaking a challenge for even the sharpest skull-stacker!\n\n",
