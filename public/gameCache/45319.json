The bigger your building is, the more people who can live inside and the more valuable they get. But watch out - the more you build, the more space you need - so it can be possible that your small building will be 'eaten' by an opponent's big castle or villa. Your landlords will lose their house and furniture except if they are sold for enough, at the right moment, to get some hidden silver instead. The winner will be the player with the biggest buildings and the most money.&#10;&#10;(Found on KOSMOS-Homepage - free translation from German)&#10;&#10;This game seems to be the game that Altura should have become.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FcUMTsu3lIQx82Po3ot-rw__original/img/uGSe28um1HQZDn5oCfVsyDjzGOc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic586489.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FcUMTsu3lIQx82Po3ot-rw__thumb/img/9xybj6jr9NxDCj7ktb8ssT7vXFc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic586489.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/45319","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.04992","averageWeight":"2.7692","boardGameRank":"10835","mechanics":["Stock Holding"],"categories":["City Building","Economic","Medieval"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer"]}}
