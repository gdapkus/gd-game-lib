Read the stars, divine the future, and twist the fates in your attempts to part folks from their precious gold. Weary adventurers visit your shop in search of hope and guidance. You offer this through lucky charms and horoscopes, but sometimes you need to do a little voodoo, too. Just be careful not to let your dark dabblings&mdash;or dirty dishes&mdash;scare away too many honest customers!&#10;&#10;The Oracle is a new merchant you can play as. It is centered around a roll &amp; write style game, with a pen, dry-erase board, and custom dice tray. Each turn you throw a handful of runes (a coin, bone, voodoo meeple, and dice) into a divided dish, then you record the results on your board in various ways to perform actions&mdash;and predict the future!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7cbtLCnmJXRBs4_SOqFPSA__original/img/PKbdM_bDj-w924pQU9YTFIj7WQg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6136543.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7cbtLCnmJXRBs4_SOqFPSA__thumb/img/5GAH20n8x_hszLmuBbreElwE9Ow=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6136543.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/286986","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
