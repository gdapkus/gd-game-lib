With great skill a tree grows by attaching leaves, branches, and now apples. Makes the game even more diversified! Whoever placed something on the tree has to take anything that falls down during installation. The level of difficulty can be adjusted by moving the trunk. A card deck brings additional excitement. This beautiful game is made out of wood, of course.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rgD74KYpg26089W0gfX33w__original/img/qGAokGWoTc6w4Kou2PgzukwrzMM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1831599.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rgD74KYpg26089W0gfX33w__thumb/img/9xABr4D4F8ZqZfNrExs0lfDNGGc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1831599.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/169368","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
