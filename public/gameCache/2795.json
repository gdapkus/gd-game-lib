Car Wars is a game featuring freeways of the future in which the right of way goes to those with the biggest guns. Players choose their vehicle &mdash; complete with weapons, armor, power plants, suspension, and even body style &mdash; then they take them out on the road, either to come home as &quot;aces&quot; or to crash and burn. If a driver survives, his abilities improve and he can earn money to buy bigger and better cars. Advanced rules let players design their own customized cars, trucks, and cycles.&#10;&#10;This entry covers Car Wars and Car Wars Deluxe, the first two editions of the rules.
