Each card is double-sided, meaning there are four roles included, two of which you can use in any given game.&#10;&#10;Card 1: Epidemiologist and Operations Expert&#10;Card 2: Generalist and Medic&#10;&#10;The key difference with these promo characters is they lose health when cubes are added to the city they are in, or if the city they are in outbreaks. If all four health of a promo character is ever exhausted, the players lose the game. This increases the difficulty of the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zsQudfB_tXkkSmy4uPq1Og__original/img/5h5mKocvuqItOGbKb86XvxWdnCs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2693012.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zsQudfB_tXkkSmy4uPq1Og__thumb/img/o3co8iYCh_-xAWUQLiet719bxQE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2693012.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/185403","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.97172","averageWeight":"2.3333","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Set Collection","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Medical"],"designers":["Matt Leacock"]}}
