In a burst of lucidity, pressed by the irreversible degradation of your planet, the great nations are forced to put aside their differences and share their knowledge in order to create the most vast spacecraft ever constructed. The Black Angel, the first intergalactic frigate in history, must transport the genetic heritage of humanity beyond known worlds, over a journey that is likely to last several thousand years. Her crew will be composed of only robots. Because no nation is willing to trust creation of the AI (artificial intelligence) that will control this crew to any other nation, a compromise is found: The Black Angel will be co-managed by several AIs, and the utility of each decision will be evaluated in VP (Validation Process).&#10;&#10;Players take the role of AI robots, piloting the Black Angel while engaging with alien species and fighting off ravagers.  Actions are determined by cards and die rolls.  Rounds continue until either of the following situations occurs: The Black Angel figurine arrives on Spes (during a Sequence B) or The Ravager card deck becomes empty (during a Sequence A). Players finish the round in progress, and then play one final round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the final round, victory points are tallied (depending on the end condition) and the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UsG5d8U0wGFJLKctASkWTQ__original/img/S3zJjTPUEcFv3gSXnWU8JfUcaCw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4830520.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UsG5d8U0wGFJLKctASkWTQ__thumb/img/WYXRiJNwu_XrUD4H0TVqFGWH2XI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4830520.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/230244","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.22483","averageWeight":"3.8534","boardGameRank":"895","mechanics":["Bias","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Map Addition","Map Reduction","Slide / Push","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"categories":["Science Fiction","Space Exploration"],"designers":["SÃ©bastien Dujardin","Xavier Georges","Alain Orban"]}}
