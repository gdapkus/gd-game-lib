Steam has started emerging from one of the test tubes, and they've all gotten dizzy to the point of passing out. When they awaken, they discover that the door is locked and no other way out seems possible. Only a notebook and an enigmatic spinning code dial seem to offer any clues for how to escape the lab...&#10;&#10;In Exit: The Game &ndash; The Secret Lab, players must use their team spirit, creativity, and powers of deduction to crack codes, solve puzzles, collect objects, and earn their freedom bit by bit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Extra material: It is highly recommended that you have pens/pencils, writing paper and scissors at hand when you play the game.&#10;Note: There is a printing error in the first English Edition on the 2nd 'Star' clue card. Please refer to the forums if you are confused after using that clue card.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3c1Wy_dXjVZ8Fpytyf9UvQ__original/img/sAMsCqIli73aTRtMJhbaYjOeucI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3332425.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3c1Wy_dXjVZ8Fpytyf9UvQ__thumb/img/nsHTKDzkuv_eo-nkzGMA1ZBcsPk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3332425.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/203417","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"150","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"150","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.05409","averageWeight":"2.5349","boardGameRank":"884","mechanics":["Cooperative Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Puzzle","Real-time"],"designers":["Inka Brand","Markus Brand"]}}
