All players receive three-dimensional pieces made of wood or plastic, which they will try to position adjacent to already placed pieces of their own color. All of their own pieces are of different shapes, which is a challenge to the three-dimensional imagination.&#10;&#10;Cubic, wedge-shaped, or pyramidal volumes are different building limitations, which are imposed by the various building scenarios. Playing RUMIS, you will find that no game is similar to any previous one. Once your mind has mastered the puzzling shapes of the RUMIS pieces, you will explore the depth of tactical and strategic possibilities offered.&#10;&#10;The rebrand by Educational Insights is labelled 1 to 4 players on the box, adding solitaire puzzles such as building a 3x3 cube with one color and building the various shapes using all the colors, following the rules of the multiplayer games while leaving no gaps in the structure.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rumis+&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pp-LXETFo29L0HLo4fMCCw__original/img/R0Q9UPYZYJhmcmv60iP9PpT4bko=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1478957.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pp-LXETFo29L0HLo4fMCCw__thumb/img/uXB_erUkU_qvcxRI8ju4gfRVl2A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1478957.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/6411","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"4"}}
