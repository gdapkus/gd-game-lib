From 2-11 players can compete in the game controlling either one team of two cars, a team of two cars plus non-scoring team cars they control, or each person playing with multiple teams. Every race has a full field of cars, regardless of player count, in order to give that true Grand Prix race feel. When racing, players will score in one of two possible ways: either individual car scoring where only placing in the top 10 places awards points; or team scoring where the placement of all cars in a race will determine the team score.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vMrNZQ2FfkQP4aUgel28pA__original/img/HIgY8_5kWhmLfMuzaDNaM2m7mQI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3202428.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vMrNZQ2FfkQP4aUgel28pA__thumb/img/JfHRyz5U7M7W3NdmqFPsbobYjQA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3202428.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/163163","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"11","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[6,11],"averageRating":"7.19346","averageWeight":"2.3182","boardGameRank":"4491","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Racing","Sports"],"designers":["Jeff Horger","Carla Horger"]}}
