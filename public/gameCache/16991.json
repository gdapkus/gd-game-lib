Deflexion) is a chess-like board game that has two built in lasers and movable Egyptian-themed game pieces that have embedded mirrors that can be positioned to bounce the laser light around the board and hit opponent pieces.&#10;&#10;To play, players alternate moving their pieces around the board. Some pieces have mirrors and some do not. Bounding the board is a raised frame into which are built two low-power lasers, one for each player. The game pieces include a &quot;pharaoh&quot;, obelisks, and pyramids with mirrors. After each move, a player must press the button on his/her laser. The beam bounces from mirror to mirror around the playing field. The challenge is to protect one's own pharaoh while maneuvering to &quot;light up&quot; the opposing player's pharaoh.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V3qUgAQLpkGU5SPffh3m2Q__original/img/odGSljFJVeANsBmkrtOWUuxdvZw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic289666.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V3qUgAQLpkGU5SPffh3m2Q__thumb/img/Vi3W4mJ9VBRAovoQ04L2Vei-Mh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic289666.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/16991","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"2"}}
