Over the course of three rounds, each team of mouse and dragon fight over tricks, treasures, and coins to see which team ends up on top!&#10;&#10;The game isn't all about winning tricks; it's about setting goals and utilizing magical treasures. If you can make enough of your goals or sabotage enough of the other team's goals, you'll have the most coins at the end of the game and be crowned king of the caves!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oVzFU44TxJvkAnn_wYqKIw__original/img/bUdlNKMhwJmfgp0hjh9J7gMZFKc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6078309.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oVzFU44TxJvkAnn_wYqKIw__thumb/img/AOT72wLDzTiz4zegolZpvEdi_7k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6078309.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/331228","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
