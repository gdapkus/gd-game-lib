You won&rsquo;t sell large goods at the piers like other merchants in town. Instead, you&rsquo;ll offer room and board to tired adventurers after the markets close for the day. But space is limited and customers are fussy&mdash;the last thing you want is folks yapping about a bad experience&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Innkeeper is a new merchant you can play as. It is centered around a speculation game, where you try to prepare rooms for the most common adventurers in play at the end of each round. If you plan well and satisfy your guests, you can yield an ever-increasing income. However, if you fail, you can expect brawls to break out&mdash;which can hurt your business!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/33pm1iZL3X8tzqqG0Ba8RA__original/img/fTjyBQHpaPCVzVyDsbUXLHd2CNM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6136541.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/33pm1iZL3X8tzqqG0Ba8RA__thumb/img/uxoKmGJpgul00lZhQvG_mzfNYLM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6136541.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/286985","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"2"}}
