In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/lL6QJ69UmZT7CeljUcjyA47b-e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3759421.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__thumb/img/O5XHaPOALYquS058qcXWVm5b_k4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3759421.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/225694","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[4,6],"averageRating":"7.76771","averageWeight":"1.8153","boardGameRank":"102","mechanics":["Communication Limits","Targeted Clues","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Party Game","Spies / Secret Agents","Word Game"],"designers":["Thomas Dagenais-Lesp√©rance"]}}
