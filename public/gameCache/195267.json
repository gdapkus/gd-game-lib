Vaccarino, builds on this already exciting world of skill acquisition and land dominance.&#10;&#10;Kingdom Builder: Harvest adds many new strategic possibilities to this already classic game. Farmland is a new terrain type which does not have terrain cards. The only way to expand into it is to build into adjacent terrains and spread into the Farmland. Silos on the board allow players at the end of the game to move up to three of their own pieces adjacent to any empty land hex next to their own settlement. The Cabin ability allows the use of two Scout meeples that can traverse land, water, or mountains. Six new Kingdom Builder cards encourage expansion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7BaAhU2UNzze-K00OuX7TQ__original/img/29gxXxWpqoHyOs3WIcT0Vsj0wrg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3718299.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7BaAhU2UNzze-K00OuX7TQ__thumb/img/sTQAs8LxUaKFn39G0fsVu9nnnUE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3718299.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/195267","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
