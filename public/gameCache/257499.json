Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies, drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It&rsquo;s a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the War to End All Wars.&#10;&#10;Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the thresholds between worlds. Occult rituals must be stopped and alien creatures destroyed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined dominion.&#10;&#10;Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror. Will they prevail?&#10;&#10;Arkham Horror (Third Edition) is a cooperative board game for one to six players who take on the roles of investigators trying to rid the world of eldritch beings known as Ancient Ones. Based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, players will have to gather clues, defeat terrifying monsters, and find tools and allies if they are to stand any chance of defeating the creatures that dwell just beyond the veil of our reality.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/09KeqyJEtu2qcskbtlOhqw__original/img/H6qePV4xg2vrwXoWcOhAhIZUtSo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5726297.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/09KeqyJEtu2qcskbtlOhqw__thumb/img/-xrcoiHjk6uaMY3dtwS_uYIrMog=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5726297.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/257499","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.69317","averageWeight":"3.3477","boardGameRank":"329","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Point to Point Movement","Stat Check Resolution","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Fighting","Horror","Novel-based"],"designers":["Nikki Valens","Richard Launius","Kevin Wilson"]}}
