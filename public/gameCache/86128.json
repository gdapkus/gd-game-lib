Use actions to gather resources and knights to protect your realm, while avoiding the watchful eyes of the king and pope. Make your barony worthy of establishing the realm&rsquo;s first cathedral!&#10;&#10;Barons is a card game which uses four different decks representing different types of land: mines, rivers, forests and pastures. Each deck contains cards representing actions, buildings (including 5 church/cathedral cards), and 9 knights.&#10;&#10;The cards have three functions: they can either be used face up as an action, knight or building; face down as land or discarded as money to pay for other cards.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a castle card surrounded by one land card of each type. On your turn, you play cards to build your barony and acquire resources, by going through three phases in order.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play action and knight cards and use building abilities.&#10;     Add one land or one building to your barony.&#10;     Tax up to four adjacent lands in your barony to draw cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;To win, you must first build a Church and then a Cathedral in your barony. The game ends immediately when someone builds a Cathedral.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJ4tqkv0qUJQMNcUueFmeA__original/img/IhjgFdrcAaj7ISvcYXOKSVc2NfI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic899791.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJ4tqkv0qUJQMNcUueFmeA__thumb/img/MfZBR8UpYfPNyL3NndZs1dGpYr8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic899791.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/86128","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
