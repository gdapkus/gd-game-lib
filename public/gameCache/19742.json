Rather than being a standalone deck, Blue Moon: Emissaries &amp; Inquisitors - Allies augments the other decks by adding cards to all the other available decks.  Interference cards allow players to react out of turn to their opponent's plays.  The powerful Hyla influence the game as a whole.  The Tutu add strength, but at a price.  The Emissaries can be added to other decks as-sold to include these new cards to the mix.  Inquisitors change the deck building limitations for players interested in constructing decks.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IeBoyy015Vmg5IiYg-AY2w__original/img/WJ2ZQGMQ_SJJYaISib8s7dWE7tE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic65125.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IeBoyy015Vmg5IiYg-AY2w__thumb/img/9XAdhxOoo14Ycyv_4cHf30C90ME=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic65125.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/19742","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.91791","averageWeight":"2.2745","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
