    "description": "4000 A.D. is a multi-player, Strategic level, unique board-wargame set two thousand years in the future, when men have spread to the planets of other stars, hundreds of light-years from the Earth. An interstellar conflict between worlds is its subject.  The concept of star travel by hyper-space is the basis of its unique playing character.&#10;&#10;4000 A.D. is pure strategy of movement, with no dice-based, chance elements.  Two to four players may play independently or in alliance with others. Players use fleets of space ships to battle opposing fleets and to claim stars.&#10;&#10;Fleets move using a hidden hyper-space movement system based on the distance between stars. No logging of hidden movement is required; all tracking is done openly which adds an element of guesswork and tension as the question arises as to where opposing fleets in hyperspace are headed.&#10;&#10;Captured stars generate more ships.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined once the last player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;",
