In Barkham Horror: The Card Game &ndash; The Meddling of Meowlathotep, a 78-card standalone scenario pack, the investigators must stop Meowlathotep, the Prowling Chaos, Meowsenger of the Outer Feline Gods, who is terrorizing the city of Barkham. Only a few precious pups can defeat the various Meowsks of Meowlathotep and prevent them from destroying Barkham and the world!&#10;&#10;When this adventure kicks off, you are hot on the trail of a cat conspiracy. A catspiracy, if you will. Dogs all across town report seeing strange, unnatural cats prowling the streets of Barkham, and each day more and more pigeons are going missing. You've picked up the scent of something big, and once you sink your teeth into a story, you just can't let go. A little wet fur has never stopped you from finding the truth. Perhaps if you investigate the areas of Arkham most plagued by these sightings, you can root out the cat&#226;&#128;&#144;monsters that dwell within.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7OfrvLPM7z-FRDnQgg8_fQ__original/img/6JMEF22l2L6Q_FgALlHgGlecn2A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5873970.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7OfrvLPM7z-FRDnQgg8_fQ__thumb/img/F0NVAoysbqp1dkPhC91mdyVO0jw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5873970.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/295594","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"2"}}
