The Corps have the place locked down tight. Wave fields may fry your brain. Ice may change shape on you mid-run. Corps expand and contract their servers at will. It's a tricky environment for any Runner to navigate, and the further you remain from your target, the more likely you'll be caught off-guard.&#10;&#10;Up and Over is the fourth Data Pack in the &quot;Lunar Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner. A search for the mysterious &quot;source code&quot; leads the game's Runners to the shadiest edges of Heinlein, the moon's only established city. The sixty cards in Up and Over (three copies each of twenty different cards) explore the city's Docklands, where even coordinated corporate crackdowns won't necessarily ferret out every black marketeer willing to provide Runners with a steady supply of illicit technology. In this new environment, to survive you must adapt. Thankfully illicit dealers will supply anything to anyone...for the right price.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3XEbR7w3FSDpIHFF2zJag__original/img/GJRnewSMQwxGGPo_NRZxFqOQjPg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2079280.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3XEbR7w3FSDpIHFF2zJag__thumb/img/vURRJbsmWch6yJiivT0cmAfDSS8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2079280.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/159073","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
