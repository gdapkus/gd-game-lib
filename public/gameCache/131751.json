These beings were seldom glimpsed, but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certain deep, steep-sided gorges that even the wolves shunned.&quot; &ndash;H.P. Lovecraft, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;&#10;&#10;Venture into the unknown with Mansions of Madness: Call of the Wild! Five new scenarios and eleven double-sided board tiles plunge investigators into the mysterious backwoods, shaking the foundations of what players have come to expect. The keeper has even more surprises at his disposal, and at times must solve ritual puzzles and seek out clues. A focus on outdoor maps encourages non-linear exploration, and new Allies assist in combat while driving the macabre narrative. Survive the wilderness in Call of the Wild!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8nOXWkLq7GkK0vh1mHIOrg__original/img/9XV74aMFaRW2caEEHEaj_kGIr44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1473795.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8nOXWkLq7GkK0vh1mHIOrg__thumb/img/erWgLpdoxJkDOZHyhw6SPxHHsqE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1473795.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/131751","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"8.12496","averageWeight":"3.4222","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Movement","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Modular Board","Pick-up and Deliver","Role Playing","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Expansion for Base-game","Exploration","Horror","Miniatures","Murder / Mystery","Puzzle","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Corey Konieczka"]}}
