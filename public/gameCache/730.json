The game concentrates on the initial landings and the subsequent breakout attempts.  The German player tries to prevent a successful Allied landing, and if that fails, to contain the beachhead.  The Allied player wins by establishing a beachhead, or (better) by successfully breaking out of the landing area.&#10;&#10;The mapboard depicts the Normandy area where the initial landings took place.  Units are regiments and brigades, representing infantry, airborne, armour artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units.&#10;&#10;The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9NYEKmPccsWVxyaOlracbg__original/img/8throOJoHy1FQ56akF1FlbferEk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5069218.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9NYEKmPccsWVxyaOlracbg__thumb/img/jDQR_NX6mmp_3oAm9NAmP3Ldq3Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5069218.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/730","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1992","playingTime":"240","minPlayingTime":"240","maxPlayingTime":"240","bestAtCount":"2"}}
