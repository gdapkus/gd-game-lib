    "description": "Witch hunt is a large-group social deduction game (like Werewolf or Mafia) for 7-22 players.  A group of Villagers must find and lynch the Witches among them during the day, while the Witches kill a target every night.\n\nUnlike similar games, dead players on both teams continue to influence the game.  Additionally, each player has a unique character with a simple ability--including the Witches.  This means the abilities of the Witch team varies wildly game-to-game.\n\n",
