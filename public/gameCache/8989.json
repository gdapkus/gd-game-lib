Players take control of the ship and buy and sell goods, establish trading posts, and sail to find new markets. The board is a very simple map of Scandinavia, with arrows from point to point restricting where the boat is able to move. The active player takes control of the boat and must pay to move to each new city where he may either buy, sell, or expand. Players want sets of goods that they can trade for victory points, but also need to expand their market presence to generate revenue.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQYc-5PfyknVcU-j80KBhQ__original/img/RMA2bZ0WfYf3cWEICJfsKE4mVlU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic311302.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQYc-5PfyknVcU-j80KBhQ__thumb/img/rY2jz1E-dw_2YioMANlEAy7DnXc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic311302.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8989","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2004","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
