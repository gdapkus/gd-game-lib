    "description": "Far away, in a land called Essentia, two Orders of spell casters have fought for the territory&rsquo;s possession through the years. Sworn enemies, the Wizards of Dawn and the Sorcerers of Twilight strive for their opponents&rsquo; end in every battle. But the number of magicians is small and their life is priceless, so they do not fight on their own but by means of golems under their command.\n\nThese battles are carried out on a strange zone where a special magic named essence provides the golems with new powers. That place, called The Changing Land, consists of several different terrains: plains, plateaus, rocks, forests and mountains. There also exist other weird zones, such as springs and circles of essence. Every magic terrain gives a certain magic power to whom tread on it so that it allows them to move or attack in different ways.\n\nToday, one more struggle is about to begin. A skilled wizard of Dawn and a clever sorcerer of Twilight are the chosen ones to handle the golems to solve the battle.\n\nThe game includes:\n\n- Organic cotton case (Format 1).\n- A4 flexible pad board.\n- 28 printed and laser-cut tiles.\n- 16 dark onyx laser-cut acrylic golems.\n- 16 translucent white laser-cut acrylic golems.\n- Rulesheet.\n\n\n",
