This new land is small and the resources are scarce, so you take what you can get and never say no to building materials. Cleverly plan and construct a thriving town, and don't let it fill up with wasted resources! Whoever builds the most prosperous tiny town wins!&#10;&#10;In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings. Each building scores victory points (VPs) in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 VP. The player with the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__original/img/-GDAsvmQ3wkuHaZ8h9G5Gk_nvVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4460401.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__thumb/img/AI-Ro3wLJtpyZLmCMNywOlpz0S8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4460401.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/265736","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.21817","averageWeight":"2.0533","boardGameRank":"450","mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Follow","Grid Coverage","Pattern Building","Player Elimination","Solo / Solitaire Game","Square Grid","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Phase Order","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Animals","City Building","Puzzle"],"designers":["Peter McPherson"]}}
