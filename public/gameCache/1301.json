The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xv_C5PpqX8kDwU-8iktmgQ__original/img/C4u4nrMitMztbos3TN8SjIL87_w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic92015.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xv_C5PpqX8kDwU-8iktmgQ__thumb/img/cmWb4qmyF5aLkAmrj7fhe77ODlo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic92015.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1301","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1996","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
