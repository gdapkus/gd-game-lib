The Graze action allows players to influence the cows, and nudge the world's climate in favour of the crops they intend to grow. With climate, comes an all-new set of climate sensitive trees; the Norway Spruce, the Baobab, the Date Palm and the Sweet Chestnut.&#10;&#10;Petrichor: Cows can be combined with any of the previous expansions Petrichor: Flowers and Petrichor: Honeybee to create some truly memorable cloud-slinging, water-sprinkling action. The expansion content is also supported when using the Southern Winds solo mode.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P6iHYtOEmJ69fSo7B-uO9g__original/img/wX0Bilws4bQikLLJMm9DLs5gPgY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5482243.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P6iHYtOEmJ69fSo7B-uO9g__thumb/img/Hmr81qTaiH6pd8yuXIQShF91HYw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5482243.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/312216","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.92972","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Modular Board","Voting"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Animals","Educational","Environmental","Farming"],"designers":["David Chircop","DÃ¡vid Turczi"]}}
