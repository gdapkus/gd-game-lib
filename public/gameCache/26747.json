    "description": "Space has become a giant dumping ground for jettisoned components and derelict spacecraft.  But the tide could be turned by clever star pilots hoping to expand their tiny ships.  Navigating through a sea of asteroids and recyclable parts, pilots collect resources and salvaged ship modules in a quest to build the largest and most complete starship. (From the first paragraph of the revised game instructions)\n\n",
