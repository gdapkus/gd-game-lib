Time goes crazy, and newly discovered crystals have exhibited strange properties that allow for the creation of fantastic apparatuses.&#10;&#10;In a race to exploit these discoveries, the rapidly industrializing nations have used them to construct gigantic steam-driven airships to travel through time and space. In Steam Time, the race is on for long-lost knowledge, vanished cultures, and hidden treasures.
