The economy is in free fall not just in New Angeles, but worldswide. For days the city lurches deeper into chaos. There are riots. There are kidnappings. And then the corps open fire on each other&hellip;&#10;&#10;There's damage everywhere in Intervention. Meat damage, brain damage, and collateral damage. In keeping with the themes and aggressive stances of the Flashpoint Cycle, Intervention continues to provide us access to a set of desperate corps forced to show their teeth. We also find a new Haas-Bioroid identity, a new Shaper identity, a handful of Runner cards that dare you to run despite the risks, and a place of sanctuary in which the Runners can hide.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IdZ8yWcWCk3UUY1lqw05DA__original/img/GI4L6v3e9J1cncSo6zaTmloFbhI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3145766.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IdZ8yWcWCk3UUY1lqw05DA__thumb/img/dmPLPXF4XE6NCqsfkPDF85NnZ4A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3145766.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/206989","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.166","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield"]}}
