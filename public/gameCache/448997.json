    "description": "Civil War explodes onto the scene of Marvel Champions: The Card Game! There are no villains this time around; instead, this expansion sees players facing off against heroic leaders fighting for their ideals. On the side of registration, Iron Man and Captain Marvel lead the charge in support of the Superhero Registration Act, while Captain America and Spider-Woman lead the resistance that opposes it. Each of these leaders comes with a fully customizable scenario, with a wide range of main schemes and modular encounter sets to build your own unique Civil War experience. Joining the roster of playable heroes are Tigra and Hulkling, both of whom come with pre-built and ready-to-play decks. Finally, the expansion also comes with rules for a brand-new, optional competitive mode in which players battle to be the first to take down the opposing team&rsquo;s leader.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
