These farmers have long used a sophisticated irrigation system to organize rice cultivation by integrating religious devotion and social responsibility with traditional farming methods. Even modern farmers seek to placate the spirit world in their quest to produce an abundant harvest.&#10;&#10;In Spirits of the Rice Paddy, players must compete with fellow rice farmers to construct and tend rice paddies. Oxen can build walls and remove large rocks. Ducks can be employed to eat harmful pests and fertilize the fledgling crops. Weeds must be kept at bay. Most importantly, water must be conserved and released with the greatest of care. With a little luck, all that back-breaking labor will pay off in the end. The good news is that the spirits are eager to assist, granting many special abilities, blessings, and magic. The farmer who produces the most rice over seven rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0eAvFBxtgRfuwf75WYPk4g__original/img/llBxDgELiWWaJDGnQhGOxXg5Dqk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2563119.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0eAvFBxtgRfuwf75WYPk4g__thumb/img/WJbFq-r1I5Snkii6c95zps3GguU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2563119.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149119","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.67778","averageWeight":"3.0816","boardGameRank":"3857","mechanics":["Enclosure","Open Drafting","Simultaneous Action Selection","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Farming","Mythology"],"designers":["Philip duBarry"]}}
