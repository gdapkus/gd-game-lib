However, each tree only grows if it is in the only empty square on a player&rsquo;s board.&#10;&#10;Place a seed on one space on your board at the start of the game.  At any point if you build on this space, gain a free resource of your choice. However, if you finish the game with only the seed remaining and no other empty spaces, it grows into a 2 point tree!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UYH-mjiiNrrRuBGADDTykw__original/img/ZQ5X1-pdFl0WsIbX-3uds2a3_1M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5711615.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UYH-mjiiNrrRuBGADDTykw__thumb/img/XIs3d5QyrPWETb5J3vH4bGhsKuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5711615.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/321679","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"1"}}
