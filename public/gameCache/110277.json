An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat. Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station. Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement. The construction lasts four years, and the alien race with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xM5-XAyoh7NwuVoguwgEsQ__original/img/JJ3gcJBHOc0-ca-Hq73wYvZRZxk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2037906.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xM5-XAyoh7NwuVoguwgEsQ__thumb/img/0Qo56PUZiko4GpS2hZ5R8q-z5VA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037906.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/110277","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.02466","averageWeight":"2.2373","boardGameRank":"921","mechanics":["Closed Drafting","Open Drafting","Simultaneous Action Selection","Tile Placement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Card Game","City Building","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Vangelis Bagiartakis"]}}
