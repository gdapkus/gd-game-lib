How far will you push yourself to score points? Players take turns scoring or flipping over cards, looking to increase their points. Turn over the wrong cards and you will be out of the round.&#10;&#10;The last player in the round is forced to play Double or Nothing which can lead to mega-points or nothing at all. Once the seventh bonus card is turned over the game ends and the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z18x4fZvuld3_g55ZQdzCQ__original/img/P_mCRFJUu3hQGKboRUiacMHWA7s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic224823.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z18x4fZvuld3_g55ZQdzCQ__thumb/img/frJsnt9TbTbE57n_2AHcX01U3Ms=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic224823.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/22111","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2006","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4,6],"averageRating":"5.7092","averageWeight":"1.1094","boardGameRank":"13564","mechanics":["Push Your Luck"],"categories":["Card Game"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
