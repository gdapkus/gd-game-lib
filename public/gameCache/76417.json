Poseidon contains most of the basics of 18xx games and due to the relatively short running time of two hours is as suitable for 18xx-newbies who want to explore this wonderful world as it is for experienced train gamers.&#10;&#10;The 18xx basics included are:&#10;1) Instead of running a corporation, players control a country/people&#10;2) The goal of the game is personal wealth, the wealthiest player at game end is the winner&#10;3) Players create trade routes similar to railway lines in 18xx games&#10;4) Trains are replaced with common modes of transportation at the time (i.e. ships) with varying types&#10;5) 18xx type stations are replaced with trading posts&#10;&#10;Game Contents: game board, eight &quot;possession sheets&quot;, play money, lots of wood pieces, cards, 1 rule book&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaibeoEk2Sl0ujV9fbptPA__original/img/knDopRWDlBgA1m1jdskMwOBdlBA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1041509.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaibeoEk2Sl0ujV9fbptPA__thumb/img/sfCiaNCpXod-wvWAbwVFLuq0WYY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1041509.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/76417","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.96724","averageWeight":"3.5377","boardGameRank":"2768","mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Network and Route Building","Stock Holding"],"categories":["Economic","Mythology","Nautical","Transportation"],"designers":["Helmut Ohley","Leonhard \"Lonny\" Orgler"]}}
