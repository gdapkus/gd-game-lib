The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various&nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story.&#10;&#10;As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Spanish and Portuguese editions of Maracaibo contain La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game's box.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__original/img/yhnCcq9UplffqjSCe08mjTFvgOM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4917407.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__thumb/img/lVlnhYyxlZb3WuKZJHLoJcFHEjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4917407.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/276025","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"8.0018","averageWeight":"3.9148","boardGameRank":"67","mechanics":["Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Events","Hand Management","Income","Movement Points","Multi-Use Cards","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Point to Point Movement","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Stock Holding","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Track Movement","Variable Set-up"],"categories":["Economic","Exploration","Nautical","Pirates"],"designers":["Alexander Pfister"]}}
