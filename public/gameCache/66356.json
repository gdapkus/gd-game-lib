A cave mouth leads to a maze of tunnels and chambers, and deep within this monster-infested labyrinth lurks the most terrifying creature of all: a red dragon!&#10;&#10;Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a rogue, thief, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeon Command: Blood of Gruumsh&#10;    Dungeon Command: Curse of Undeath&#10;    Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth&#10;    Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins&#10;    Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyr&#10;&#10;&#10;Can also integrate with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Waterdeep &#226;&#128;&#147; Dungeon of the Mad Mage Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Ghosts of Saltmarsh Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jIisRmDxzy6UfiRRpi1Xdw__original/img/o1G0yEkBcvwGa3iC88kkzjKuPEI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic968280.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jIisRmDxzy6UfiRRpi1Xdw__thumb/img/vDPsmmoz_a6DD6ksbUOiqm16XlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic968280.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66356","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"7.08995","averageWeight":"2.6044","boardGameRank":"1045","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Role Playing","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Exploration","Fantasy","Fighting","Miniatures"],"designers":["Peter Lee","Bill Slavicsek"]}}
