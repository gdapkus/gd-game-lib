With your (not-always-honestly-won) money, you'll improve your ships by buying advancement cards, giving you powerful additional abilities.&#10;&#10;Outwit your opponents with fortune cards and combos, earn money faster than they do, and pay the ransom for the governor's daughter to win the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A-KaF84pQ7V8IAZULQNqKg__original/img/jQSWb6LWCtAkGeLVlQDj6an6ED4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1987366.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A-KaF84pQ7V8IAZULQNqKg__thumb/img/t6JsS2kb5qfi0CVFe5o08WGlQ2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1987366.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/157403","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.99895","averageWeight":"1.9372","boardGameRank":"1111","mechanics":["Area Movement","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Pick-up and Deliver","Take That","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Nautical","Pirates","Transportation"],"designers":["Sebastian Bleasdale"]}}
