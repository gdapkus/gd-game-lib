Each morning the Grade Ones arrive with rocks they've gathered, then haul away the rocks that you don't need anymore &ndash; but there aren't enough Grade One initiates to go around, so there will be competition for the best selection of rocks. The Grade Ones will give their new rocks to whoever gives them the fewest old rocks to haul away.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind while creating your garden, however, that certain combinations of rocks must be avoided! Every afternoon, the Feng Shui Masters come by to check your work. You'll receive demerits for any forbidden combinations &ndash; but you'll also receive demerits for your laziness if you don't add new stones each day, so you must find a balance.&#10;&#10;The Masters' final evaluation will come with no advance warning. The Initiate who has the fewest demerits will advance to Grade Three, while the one with the most demerits will be kicked down to Grade One, joining the others in the daily search for new rocks...&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42gepQV9vYtXbAjWKRzm-g__original/img/dH2f92YVFpYB-unbUYLl5Dg0lJo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1594427.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42gepQV9vYtXbAjWKRzm-g__thumb/img/WgNaRFvD1SiZn64ebZw6aQ1W0VA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1594427.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/139572","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.41605","averageWeight":"2.15","boardGameRank":"7876","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Set Collection"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"designers":["Joseph Kisenwether"]}}
