    "description": "Unlock! is a cooperative card game inspired by escape rooms that uses a simple system which allows you to search scenes, combine objects, and solve riddles. Play Unlock! to embark on great adventures, while seated at a table using only cards and a companion app that can provide clues, check codes, monitor time remaining, etc.\n\nIn the Clutches of Hades - You are Alix, a slave in Greece during antiquity. Gaining your freedom will not be an easy task unless you ask the Gods for help.\n\nAn included ten-card tutorial allows you to learn how to play without reading the game rules. Note: Unlock! requires a free application to be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play. Once downloaded, an internet connection is not required during game play.\n\n",
