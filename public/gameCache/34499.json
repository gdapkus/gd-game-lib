It also includes some blank cards for players to make their own cards.&#10;&#10;The new cards include four start worlds, three 6-cost developments, two other new developments (and one duplicate development), five military worlds and six non-military worlds (including a replacement gambling world).  Goals consist of  &lsquo;First Goals&rsquo;, which reward the first player to achieve an objective with 3 extra VP, and &lsquo;Most Goals&rsquo; reward the player with the most developments, military or certain types of worlds.  An extra set of player cards and VP chips allows for a 5th player, and a robot template, dice, and chits allows for a solitaire game.  Finally drafting rules provide a different way of playing the game for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHK2ry5-IhSr2cv4DP3JkQ__original/img/93zCo6TI4WrXkj3qB2kQLFOlfDA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic376993.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHK2ry5-IhSr2cv4DP3JkQ__thumb/img/x5hUrvtJ0ttO3JtHHZoXs8ucMj0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic376993.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/34499","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.08901","averageWeight":"2.9905","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Phase Order","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Card Game","Civilization","Economic","Science Fiction","Space Exploration"],"designers":["Thomas Lehmann"]}}
