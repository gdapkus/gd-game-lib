Since all cards show their color on the back, the players have more information than usual. In addition to cards in hand, the game includes a common supply of cards, some of which can be added to the tricks to make it easier to reach a player's goal. This strategy might backfire, however, if cards of the wrong color make it into a trick and you're aiming for a low score in that color.&#10;&#10;During each trick, you must follow suit, even with the special trump cards. This also makes it difficult to correctly predict which tricks you'll get. In the end, the player who comes closest to his predictions wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0SpXGsuBHiGgTF2Kdrb8Q__original/img/rGLvxb5nbJgvpY0R-xUZeIU4vDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1939173.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0SpXGsuBHiGgTF2Kdrb8Q__thumb/img/CvdsbuY93w9RCLMbCIJgOnwWN_c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1939173.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/153480","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.96537","averageWeight":"2.125","boardGameRank":"5575","mechanics":["Trick-taking"],"categories":["Card Game"],"designers":["Arve D.
