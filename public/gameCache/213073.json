Players take turns flicking discs in order to tip a cow (a.k.a. knock it over). Obstacles are in the way, however, and you lose a turn knocking into a tree. Hit a cowpie, and you lose one of your flickers.&#10;&#10;After all cows are tipped, they score one point each or a loss of two for knocking over the bull. Special and optional rules add to the game for the different types of cows.&#10;&#10;Highest score wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eLh-h49fkJrRJ5CtkpF_rA__original/img/ixvsxvZbCGYZYpedcOppq3WdYHY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3259540.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eLh-h49fkJrRJ5CtkpF_rA__thumb/img/L8M7FjGyntdmBBsyhJxafLrVPEc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3259540.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/213073","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"3.65556","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Action / Dexterity"],"designers":["Grant Dalgliesh"]}}
