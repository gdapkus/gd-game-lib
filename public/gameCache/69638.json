    "description": "Backwards up the mossy glen\nTurned and trooped the goblin men\nWith their shrill repeated cry,\n\"Come buy, come buy.\"\n\nDealing with goblins is always a struggle with temptation, leading through in the loss of innocence, ultimately revealing the power of sisterhood. Yet goblins are oblivious to symbolism. For them, it is just a matter of economics.\n\nThis Decktet game, inspired by Christina Rossetti's poem of the same name, is a series of auctions in which players buy cards on the goblins' terms: They'll give you coins for nothing, until you've won some auctions --- but later, your only way to get more coins will be from your fellow players.\n\nThis description is adapted from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.\n\nRules: Decktet Wiki\n\n",
