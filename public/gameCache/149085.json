Just anticipate the moves that matter.&rdquo;&#10;    &ndash;Reina Roja&#10;&#10;Double Time is the sixth and final Data Pack in the &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner, and it introduces a handful of powerful Double events and operations. Doubles all require their owner to spend a click to play them, in addition to their normal costs, meaning they&rsquo;re high-risk gambles in a game that&rsquo;s as full of bluffs, counter-bluffs, risks, and gambles as Android: Netrunner.&#10;&#10;Still, if you play them right, these Doubles can offer tremendous rewards. In Double Time, you&rsquo;ll find a significant focus on these events. Twenty-one of them are mixed into the Data Pack&rsquo;s sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards), along with new hardware, programs, ice, upgrades, and more. Will you sacrifice versatility for raw power? It&rsquo;s time to Double down!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Nz9_-1Hh657B_6Hhv9TbQ__original/img/Fklr_bIW-7S2rbxljhVipCyKYvY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1854611.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Nz9_-1Hh657B_6Hhv9TbQ__thumb/img/3CH3lXgvqhDewmhLDFYs44oGNcM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1854611.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149085","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.0873","averageWeight":"3.5882","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield","Lukas Litzsinger"]}}
