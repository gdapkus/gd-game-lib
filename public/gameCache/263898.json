When setting up the playing area, the Cutpurse is laid out as an additional third market tile next to the Coin Changer and the Head Merchant.&#10;&#10;When a player draws one or more black counterfeit coins from his or her purse, these coins are not set immediately onto his or her character tile anymore. Instead, the black coins are set next to his or her side of the Cutpurse.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player has set three or more counterfeit coins next to the Cutpurse at the end of his or her turn, this player receives the Cutpurse's services. The player may choose to either:&#10;&#10;Steal one seal from the next player in clockwise order who has one or more seals,&#10;&#10;or&#10;&#10;Receive as many reputation points as there are currently universal tender coins (white coins) set next to all merchandise and market tiles. It does not matter whether they are the player's own universal tender coins or whether they belong to other players. The player then moves his or her scoring marker forward this number of spaces in a clockwise direction on the game board.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNjo-jWjVoHSNyzHmAR1VA__original/img/pWnZ1kcEpOUFCOGaW1pRttnkvtc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4387843.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNjo-jWjVoHSNyzHmAR1VA__thumb/img/2giLuAWY12P5ipb1bHRaLZkU6E0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4387843.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/263898","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"6.98317","averageWeight":"2","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["RÃ¼diger Dorn"]}}
