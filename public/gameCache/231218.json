According to the sonnets, the Dark Lady seduced the poet and held him in an agonised thrall while also conducting an affair with the Fair Youth whom Shakespeare also loved.&#10;&#10;In Black Sonata you will find yourself in Shakespeare's London, circa 1600, in pursuit of the shadowy Lady. A specially ordered deck of cards determines her hidden movements from place to place. You must deduce her location and then intercept her to catch a glimpse and gain a clue to her identity. You will need several clues to deduce her identity, but with each clue gained the Lady becomes harder to track. Black Sonata combines hidden movement and logical deduction into a unique solitaire steeped in literary history.&#10;&#10;Can you finally solve English literature's greatest mystery? Or will the Dark Lady elude you, melting from your grasp like a curl of smoke and promises?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UgE_mVxqPMMNKOvXWqC71g__original/img/x6WHFifE2JApTb_Gpg4o99c7xJw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3657983.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UgE_mVxqPMMNKOvXWqC71g__thumb/img/slBCxAKehDCtJxFCwUCAuu_Opwg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3657983.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/231218","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"7.46196","averageWeight":"2.0879","boardGameRank":"961","mechanics":["Action Queue","Deduction","Hidden Movement","Point to Point Movement","Push Your Luck","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Print & Play","Renaissance"],"designers":["John Kean"]}}
