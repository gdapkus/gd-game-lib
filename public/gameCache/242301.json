The new Equinox mechanic allows players to greatly speed up gameplay and can even scale up to 6&ndash;player games with the two additional starter decks provided. The new conclaves grant players the option to customize the starting decks of advancements and vales, creating a new play experience each game. Unique totem cards imbue players with awesome abilities they can use each turn, to truly feel the power of Gaia&rsquo;s blessing.
