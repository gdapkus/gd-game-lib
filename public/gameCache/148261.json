Players take on the role of a mainland empire that consults with a consortium of advisors to discover new islands, explore those islands, develop trade, send out raiding parties, take part in ship-to-ship combat, and more. As in Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy, co-designed by Rob Daviau, SeaFall evolves as the game is played, setting their grudges into the history of the game and building a different narrative at every table as players open up the world.&#10;&#10;Due to the complexity of rules interactions in this game, the community (primarily Becq) has created a FAQ called The Captain&#039;s Log.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8NYsQTJuPs_XVN2x1PdT4A__original/img/msI3oIsaN1sccC-KIs0FbVn3gNQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3571648.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8NYsQTJuPs_XVN2x1PdT4A__thumb/img/KBNn5qIs2qJeS9n3Fit7KbvYgeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3571648.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/148261","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.1795","averageWeight":"3.8053","boardGameRank":"3867","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Legacy Game","Trading","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Civilization","Exploration","Nautical"],"designers":["Rob Daviau"]}}
