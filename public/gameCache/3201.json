Each player controls a force of 9 unique characters (light vs. dark) whose identities are hidden from their opponent at the beginning of the game. Each player also starts with a hand of 9 unique cards, which are used in resolving combats as the characters move out across the board. The victory conditions of the players are also asymmetrical: the Fellowship player wins by moving Frodo into Mordor (thus destroying the One Ring), while the Evil player wins either by killing Frodo or by moving 3 Evil characters into the Shire.&#10;&#10;Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has also been the object of an extended edition (see Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation) comprising the original characters and a full set of new characters.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_hBlhE0at6aow5G1I8-NMg__original/img/0fKUj-zz4WDe5210VojrpVJDn0Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic69357.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_hBlhE0at6aow5G1I8-NMg__thumb/img/bsfevmaHrJxqdDW-OKfWKy9eUdM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic69357.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3201","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.21733","averageWeight":"2.172","boardGameRank":"720","mechanics":["Area Movement","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management","Memory","Secret Unit Deployment","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Bluffing","Deduction","Fantasy","Movies / TV / Radio theme","Novel-based"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
