    "description": "Unlock! is a cooperative card game inspired by escape rooms that uses a simple system which allows you to search scenes, combine objects, and solve riddles. Play Unlock! to embark on great adventures, while seated at a table using only cards and a companion app that can provide clues, check codes, monitor time remaining, etc.\n\nIn the cartoon-style adventure Unlock! Squeek & Sausage, you need to stop the mad Professor Noside from destroying the world. In your attempt to thwart his plot, the evil genius has caught you in a trap, and you can't stop him until you've found a way out. Can you escape and foil his plot before the clock hits zero?\n\nAn included ten-card tutorial allows you to learn how to play without reading the game rules. Note: Unlock! requires a free application to be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play. Once downloaded, an internet connection is not required during game play.\n\n",
