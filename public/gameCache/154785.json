The stars in the sector are too young to support colonizable planets, yet for brave explorers the Nebula offers powerful Discoveries and a perfect hiding place...&#10;&#10;The expansion contains two Nebula hexes, one Ancient Monolith Discovery Tile and one Development / Rare Technology Board (on the back side of the rules sheet).&#10;&#10;The two Nebula hexes are shuffled with the other Sector hexes before building the Middle and Outer Sector stacks. The Discovery Tile is shuffled with the other Discovery Tiles.&#10;&#10;The Nebula is divided into three subsectors, connected by Wormholes. For Move, Explore and Influence rules purposes, each subsector functions exactly like a normal hex. When you Explore and place the Nebula, place one Discovery tile in each subsector with an Discovery symbol and one Ancient Ship in the subsector with the Ancient symbol. You cannot place an Influence Disc on the hex. The Discovery Tiles can only be claimed by having a Ship in the subsector at the end of the Combat Phase. If you place a Discovery Tile benefit in the Nebula, you must place it in the subsector where it was found.&#10;&#10;When you collect the Ancient Monolith tile, place it in the hex where you found it. It functions just like a normal Monolith.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vD1NHJe14B6YiiuS32Ju6g__original/img/ps9H0o-GS_NzJTDekp3CO4FDocc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2047784.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vD1NHJe14B6YiiuS32Ju6g__thumb/img/VkhmmeWxy3aG0l9wytwUUj8OJug=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2047784.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/154785","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"6"}}
