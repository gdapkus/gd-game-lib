Flipping a forest token over indicates the movement of the player's meeple to an action spot on the board. Gather or trade resources, visit the construction site or get a helper token for the kid's dog Guff who will fetch any resource when it's time to build a hut. The construction site is where huts can be build. Each requires a different set of resources. A visit the to construction site also resets the forest tokens: Flip the tokens back over and swap a couple of them to introduce some challenge.&#10;&#10;Use your memory to find the fastest paths to gather resources and built 3 huts before everyone else to be the winner of My First Stone Age.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/11Z-S3LYwZVgn7adwvMg_g__original/img/jCegVFVy446-Xh2vFk-bzSD-oEo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2830962.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/11Z-S3LYwZVgn7adwvMg_g__thumb/img/1EHTgtmCm9w1PSjgRGMpti5eaIo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2830962.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/191004","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"6.63262","averageWeight":"1.1324","boardGameRank":"2401","mechanics":["Memory","Set Collection"],"categories":["Children's Game","Memory","Prehistoric"],"designers":["Marco Teubner"]}}
