They keep calling up for more barrels of quicksilver, or bits of your hair. Well it's all in the name of progress. They're looking for a way to turn lead into gold, or at least into something better than lead. That lead had just been too good of a bargain to pass up; you didn't think, where will I put all this lead, what am I going to do with this lead anyway. Well that will all be sorted out. They're also looking for a universal solvent. If they manage that one, you will take whatever they use to hold it in and build a castle out of it. A castle that can't be dissolved! Now that's progress.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Alchemy is an expansion, and can't be played by itself; to play with it, you need Dominion a standalone expansion to Dominion (Dominion: Intrigue), or Dominion Base Cards . Those provide the Basic cards you need to play (Treasure, Victory, and Curse cards), as well as the full rules for setup and gameplay. Dominion: Alchemy can also be combined with any other Dominion expansions you have.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mwz6KkKz5F_NtmGtZKTwxQ__original/img/a_GfPrwPUN4Zm9CkcskwOyS_T48=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic698779.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mwz6KkKz5F_NtmGtZKTwxQ__thumb/img/UaQDZw9glX1m9dyOr27OkpMjWX8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic698779.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66098","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"6.92456","averageWeight":"2.4559","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Delayed Purchase","Hand Management","Open Drafting"],"categories":["Card Game","Expansion for Base-game","Medieval"],"designers":["Donald X.
