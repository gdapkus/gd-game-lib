You will play the game above the painting that he made. You will start as Peasants, sowing the ground and selling your crop along the Via Francigena. If you will save enough florins you will be more comfortably off, trading in cloth and spices throughout Tuscany. But your dream is bigger: to enter the Council of the Nine, the town&rsquo;s government. Therefore you will have to change into Bankers and use your money to obtain the Senesi&rsquo;s consent: will you finance the artists of that time or contribute towards the construction of the new Torre del Mangia? Be careful, the florins that you have saved could not be enough! Behind every corner of the town other players&rsquo; pitfalls hide themselves: beggars, thieves, pretty women inside the inn... &#10;Be prepared for a unique game experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wb8pvgFmW9IH-upj8XB-KA__original/img/RFtp7kZVguHraFzRPCeXLxqHhDk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic99088.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wb8pvgFmW9IH-upj8XB-KA__thumb/img/fLkWcZdIkZNJfM7oc_4YBVj2Eyo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic99088.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/18932","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"5"}}
