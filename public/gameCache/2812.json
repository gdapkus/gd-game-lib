The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.&#10;&#10;The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.&#10;&#10;The game uses two elements to create fog of war:&#10;-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and &quot;substitutes&quot; (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)&#10;-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.&#10;&#10;Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DdZzQ16cUkZydoGyTJpo7Q__original/img/OpSGjoCqFBljtO-6m_7H_kIJ_MY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic335686.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DdZzQ16cUkZydoGyTJpo7Q__thumb/img/eUCU7EdwRxKkF9ocC0lzDFHQX6Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic335686.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2812","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1986","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"5.91972","averageWeight":"2.1081","boardGameRank":"14732","mechanics":["Chit-Pull System","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Secret Unit Deployment","Simulation"],"categories":["Movies / TV / Radio theme","Vietnam War","Wargame"],"designers":["S.
