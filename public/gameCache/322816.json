Can you defeat the ravaging orcs and bring back peace and prosperity to your people?&#10;&#10;In Caverna: Frantic Fiends, the second large expansion for Uwe Rosenberg's Caverna: The Cave Farmers, you have to face these hostile plunderers. Luckily, you can either use your proven axes to teach them a lesson or build traps to keep them away from the cave entrances altogether. You can even push them into these traps with stone or bribe them with wood to weaken their strength. Defeating orcs will bring precious rewards, but if you fail to drive them off, all your plans might be in jeopardy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4ZE-DPD_UCbMV6-pyTAxjA__original/img/Arzu65FhuITQe5AvXezUyqr11os=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7353816.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4ZE-DPD_UCbMV6-pyTAxjA__thumb/img/tQdBEinNg9uiU-SLbCqwuRts7OM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7353816.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/322816","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"210","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"210","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"6.80268","averageWeight":"3.8","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Automatic Resource Growth","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Pattern Movement","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Claim Action"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Animals","Economic","Fantasy","Farming"],"designers":["Karl-Heinz Kettl","JÃ¼rgen Mayrhofer","Uwe Rosenberg"]}}
