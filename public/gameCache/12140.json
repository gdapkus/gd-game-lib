    "description": "\"Stalingrad Pocket: 2nd Edition &ndash; The Wehrmacht's Greatest Disaster\", covers the Soviet counteroffensive and the German operations to hold the pincers apart and (if that fails) to relieve the Stalingrad pocket.

German play requires sabre-like use of mobile reserves in hit and run attacks.\n\nHistory: (from the back of the box:)\nThe German Wehrmacht stands at the pinnacle of  its last season of blitzkrieg. Embattled German troops hold most of the city of Stalingrad &shy; but the flanks are covered with less dependable Axis allied units.

They are poised to encircle Stalingrad and turn the tide of the war.\n\nThe Game: \n2nd Edition Stalingrad Pocket: \nThis is the second edition of Stalingrad Pocket, winner of the 1992 CSR Award for Best World War 2 wargame.
