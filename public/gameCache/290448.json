These birds feature a variety of new abilities, including a number of birds with round end abilities, abilities that increase interaction between players, and birds that benefit from excess cards/food. Along with the new bonus cards, they&rsquo;re designed to be shuffled into the original decks of cards (and cards from future expansions).&#10;&#10;The European Expansion also includes an additional tray for storing the growing collection of birds (past, present, and future), as well as 15 purple eggs, extra food tokens, and a colorful new scorepad designed for both multi-player and single-player scoring. It's designed by Elizabeth Hargrave and features birds illustrated by Natalia Rojas and Ana Maria Martinez.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7izK8WM_bgtvBzxQvLGz-A__original/img/NFkKrFCKJ1YUC1x7bpx-WVDhLq0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4982682.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7izK8WM_bgtvBzxQvLGz-A__thumb/img/Q76pV0p00R8qkcS6o-nczJD7DCk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4982682.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/290448","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"70","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"70","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"8.34557","averageWeight":"2.433","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Animals","Economic","Educational"],"designers":["Elizabeth Hargrave"]}}
