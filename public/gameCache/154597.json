As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface. (The pieces themselves become the board.) Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The first player to totally surround the opponent's queen wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qxB2LU0536eKeByvNl3vcA__original/img/HxR4sVxK_YUaOSz89J_Y-o4qBcM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8229329.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qxB2LU0536eKeByvNl3vcA__thumb/img/u-Mm0YOkr4MkmQqHLkh0uHTxHDI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8229329.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/154597","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.69817","averageWeight":"2.2439","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Enclosure","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Pieces as Map","Slide / Push","Three Dimensional Movement","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Animals"],"designers":["John Yianni"]}}
