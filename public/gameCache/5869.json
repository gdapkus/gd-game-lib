Reward is in the form of build points, which can be used to build towns, castles, and wage combat against Mordred.  Risk is that of aiding Mordred in his expansion across the countryside.&#10;&#10;The game ends with an assessment of the victor:  If King Arthur has more towns/castles in play than Mordred has men on the board, then the player with the most victory points is the winner.  If Mordred has more men in play, then the player who aided Mordred the least is victorious.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3R7J2jnQnxOp22uhlrXC1w__original/img/T9D-alr0bTvW4YtXSLOqkyNk3Y8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic300460.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3R7J2jnQnxOp22uhlrXC1w__thumb/img/4KI2qJqXsrO-jtE07Lll6kHQYsU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic300460.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5869","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1999","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.18451","averageWeight":"1.9775","boardGameRank":"6834","mechanics":["Dice Rolling"],"categories":["Medieval","Territory Building"],"designers":["Martin Wallace"]}}
