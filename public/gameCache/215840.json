    "description": "The castle is the highlight of the hike, but hardly have the hikers entered the old walls, when the squeaky doors close. Escape appears impossible &mdash; but strange hints may lead players in a new direction. Can they solve the riddles and find the way to freedom?\n\nExit: The Game &ndash; The Forbidden Castle is a puzzle game modeled after escape rooms.\n\n",
