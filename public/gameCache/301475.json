You&rsquo;ve been sent to make sure there is an uneventful transition into a new age of peace. To be a successful Emissary, you must play all 14 cards.&#10;&#10;Hierarchy: Emissary comes with 3 double sided Edict cards that give special abilities, as well as three alternate game cards (Impostor, Tower, and Surgeon) to swap in for solo play.&#10;&#10;At any time, you may discard an Edict card to use its printed ability. You must be able to resolve the card in order to use it. For example, if there are no cards left in the deck, you cannot &ldquo;Return a card to the bottom of the deck.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It also comes in three levels of difficulty. In the Standard and Expert difficulties, after you fully resolve the Edict, you must remove the bottom card in the line and place it on top of its deck, extending the length of the game.&#10;&#10;While it's not required, we also made a sweet playmat for solo play. If you like to go all out, the playmats are always really nice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_p_kBwSOXNOWejHZhyPKIg__original/img/xWeQ4Rxu4AwnSAUtydbvrU4s32Y=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5226375.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_p_kBwSOXNOWejHZhyPKIg__thumb/img/mJYWgyOz3KnPEMNpEzgryT1XWWs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5226375.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/301475","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
