After suffering the unstoppable hunger of the segmented titan scuttling through cities, its mandibles shoving anything they can grasp into its waiting mouth, the tacticians of Project: ELITE put together a plan. They lured it into a tight valley with high-radiation salvage bait and closed off one end with heavy ordnance.
