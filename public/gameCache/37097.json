    "description": "Quincunx is a Decktet game for 2 to 4 players (with a solitaire variant).\n\nThe game is played on a five by five grid. On your turn, you add one card to the spread, score points depending on the connections between the played card and nearby cards, and possibly draw cards depending on those connections. You are penalized for any cards left in your hand at the end of the game.\n\n",
