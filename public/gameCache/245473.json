In occult and illicit places, necromancers and alchemists dig deeper each day towards the doors of the Underworld. At the risk of awakening something that goes far beyond their imagination...&#10;&#10;Paper Tales: Beyond the Gates contains twenty new units and six new buildings that are meant to both preserve the balance of the base game and enhance its possibilities and replay value. With this expansion, players can now start with a set of seven buildings available, out of eleven, and these buildings are different every game. Each new building opens new strategies, as does the impact of the new units.&#10;&#10;Beyond the Gate also includes all components needed for supporting up to seven players. It also includes a solo mode in which a single player has to face the powerful armies of the Lich King. This mode comes with specific Necropolis and Lich King cards.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d0IWKs0qrVZ8P-AgayYy8Q__original/img/fzyzGx_jkH2so_r48zw1Q6qdSgY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4261957.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d0IWKs0qrVZ8P-AgayYy8Q__thumb/img/XhLRxK4FzYueno_OP0zh5xYQ_qQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4261957.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/245473","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
