At the beginning of the game, place them into the bag with the other bricks. A Joker can be used in place of a brick of another color. You cannot start a Tower with a Joker, but you may use one to extend a Tower of any color. Joker bricks may not be acquired by trading in phase 2, but they can be acquired when you buy a card with a Joker brick on it. The Alchemist card may be used to take a Joker brick from the bag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eQzrrleCgaVBBpx7r1n0-Q__original/img/LfVwbl1sJOB17drRBBJYvw8ttSc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4386512.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eQzrrleCgaVBBpx7r1n0-Q__thumb/img/sT3SSdC97WeskKetYtjd52e2yUg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4386512.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/263482","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":null}}
