Some events may have small consequences, while others are nearly cataclysmic in their impact.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn (except the first) a new event card is drawn and put into play. The next Upcoming Event is also visible, so players know what faces them on the next turn.&#10;&#10;This expansion was created by Laurent Verrier, Special Prize Winner of the Small World Design Contest. Philippe Keyaerts, the original game&rsquo;s author, provided additional development assistance.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IfhSwwtUnufE_4vTESepeQ__original/img/xUFM2ygkjPeJMSIT6TBt4d_xp-c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic728313.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IfhSwwtUnufE_4vTESepeQ__thumb/img/xOQhuhldN2Lio9l1Jh7WESlZe7Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic728313.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/71818","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"80","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"80","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"7.22369","averageWeight":"2.1677","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Auction / Bidding","Dice Rolling","Events","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Fighting","Territory Building"],"designers":["Philippe Keyaerts","Laurent Verrier"]}}
