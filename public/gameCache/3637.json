    "description": "Set in the 21st century, the map depicts the inner Solar system out to Jupiter.  Scenarios involve racing, pirating, invasions, and a few others.\n\nMovement involves vector mechanics.  Players plot courses using a grease pencil on the map and use fuel to accelerate a maximum of one each turn.  Planets and moons are used to modify the trajectory.\n\nThere are a limited number of ships.  Most are limited in fuel, so making efficient use of gravity is important to reaching a destination.\n\n2nd edition came out in 1981.  A 3rd edition was released in 2018 by Steve Jackson Games.\n\nIt is fairly easy to extend the game to much more than 3 players, although the board can become cluttered with ship trails (the game is sorta like Crayon Rails in this respect).\n\n",
