The dice represent resources that players spend to play cards and perform other actions. During the game, you increase your production of dice, terraform, place cities and greenery tiles on the board, and gain various bonuses. Each turn, you either produce new dice (Production Turn) or perform actions (Action Turn).&#10;&#10;Whenever you terraform Mars (raise oxygen or temperature, or place an ocean tile), you gain 2 Victory Points (VP). You can also gain VP for placing tiles and playing cards, as well as winning Awards and Milestones.&#10;&#10;The game ends when two of the three global parameters &mdash; oxygen/temperature/ocean &mdash; have been completed. The player with most VP wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZaBpuleG30S1-hAmJnL4RA__original/img/V1kFJ4iZmcH94m7gNYgHvuMny0w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7077185.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZaBpuleG30S1-hAmJnL4RA__thumb/img/7AM38OD3FPy_I1Z2t8HP2GYz4WU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7077185.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/296108","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"2"}}
