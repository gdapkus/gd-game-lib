The colors and palette of Cubo are inspired by the Holi Festival of Colors, Happiness and Peace, a festival that celebrates a wonderful message and ties in nicely with the social and friendly event of boardgaming.&#10;&#10;Cubo has a real-time mechanism that is brought forth not with a timer, but rather by a limited resource: the four dice in the center of the table. Gain as many points as possible with your nine dice by composing straights and trips.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F4iujQlnFgNrvo2mQFVh2w__original/img/I4FepXHMtw2ARV_HelSCq7iaQCE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2335547.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F4iujQlnFgNrvo2mQFVh2w__thumb/img/XD3StiaSFF5CkAX7FSR1Fxx0B6Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2335547.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/166532","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"5.63608","averageWeight":"1.5833","boardGameRank":"19347","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Pattern Building","Set Collection"],"categories":["Dice","Real-time"],"designers":["Johannes Berger","Julien Gupta"]}}
