These new minion pieces will replace the generic ones from the base game.&#10;&#10;From the Kickstarter: The Orc Minions are made up of large numbers of savage warriors and swift Wolf Riders that swarm over the Realm. Although weaker in combat than the Demons, Undead, or Dragon Armies, their vast numbers can lead to a quick Dark Lord victory if not kept in check. The elite Wolf Riders roam the realm making the movement of the Realm Troops and Heroes difficult, disrupting Hero Quests and attack plans. The Orc Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Orc Warriors and 5 Wolf Riders, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LtVmUZL4u5yMoz8BifeMrg__original/img/cVxibnmXH84RDrHaaRoKwVrzg4E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2246296.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LtVmUZL4u5yMoz8BifeMrg__thumb/img/AGv2K-e9wXeBgKugpM3F2URlkVw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2246296.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/146281","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.80408","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Expansion for Base-game","Fantasy","Fighting","Miniatures"],"designers":["Richard Launius"]}}
