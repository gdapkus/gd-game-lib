You must do something!&#10;&#10;In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, they will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as their unit grows stronger and deadlier. They will succeed...or die trying.&#10;&#10;D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit. Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead.&#10;&#10;Note: This listing is for the commercial version of D-Day Dice.
