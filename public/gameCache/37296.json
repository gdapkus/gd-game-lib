Players try to roll dice to match cards that are face up on the board. If they match, they place their dice in their holder with their card in front of them. Each subsequent player can now try for any of the cards on the board, including the ones other players have taken, if they can beat their dice roll.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2flpKrrZx5LzMyyf60HVAw__original/img/nPnCmUTZRBMbkyxxoZecwhJxauE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic348628.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2flpKrrZx5LzMyyf60HVAw__thumb/img/bqAIWq1ZDdyp3FKw7uT-CnuHED0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic348628.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/37296","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.25196","averageWeight":"1.2281","boardGameRank":"6196","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Push Your Luck"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["Richard Borg"]}}
