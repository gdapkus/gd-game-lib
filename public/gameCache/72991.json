The game is played over 4 rounds (years), during which you will be acquiring the pieces for your towers and assembling them.&#10;&#10;Players are given a hand of cards with different colors.  On their turn, players play a card from their hand to an action space on the board.  These spaces allow players to acquire tower pieces, get money, build a portion of their towers, etc.  Once a card has been played in one of the action spaces on the board, all subsequent cards played in that area have to follow the original card&rsquo;s color.  Turns continue around the table until all players are out of cards for that round.&#10;     &#10;Scoring happens at the end of each round based on the number of towers a player has and the ornamentation present on those towers.  After the scoring at the end of round 4, a final scoring occurs and bonus prestige points are given to the players with the largest towers of each color, the most towers, and the largest tower overall. The player with the most prestige points is the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kmvWFYCQNzjMjF3PhWzcLw__original/img/TX1Zo-SHRYSnCdm_88l-JsMcMwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic745896.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kmvWFYCQNzjMjF3PhWzcLw__thumb/img/wlQxXm25kmx7kOAcqih7oN_CWYo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic745896.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/72991","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"4"}}
