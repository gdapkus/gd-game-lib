Seize the dice and roll, you scurvy Orc lover!&#10;&#10;Coins earn you silver, Grog gives you the power to re-roll your dice, Cannons let you attack merchant ships or opponents to take their silver, and Maps move your ship forward. Watch out for the curses though, because each one you roll means a silver coin lost to Exekratys, or more commonly known as Skull Island to true Corsairs.&#10;&#10;Your Captain card gives you a special player power that could help you win, if you use it to your best advantage.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach Skull Island will get all of the coins lost to cursed dice, but if that doesn't fill your sixth treasure chest, the race resets and you keep on sailing. And, if you no Captain gains their sixth treasure by the second time someone reaches Skull Island, the game ends and the Captain with the most Treasure and Silver wins the game!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G-qU1LW-hYhDzHDd0FoVKg__original/img/w5_VWzsZ8gRjw5Od_1MFlw-OuFw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4821697.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G-qU1LW-hYhDzHDd0FoVKg__thumb/img/EI5vVZ5090VzRqxk1V9XTtfkjm0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4821697.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/274230","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"4"}}
