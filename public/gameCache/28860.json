    "description": "You are the chosen leader of one of up to four clans that have converged on Totem land. Your charge: to build Totem poles along with other competing clans, using your allocated 8 precious totems.\n\nEach totem has a unique value on it. The goal is to finish the game with as many of your most valuable totem pieces on top of the totem poles as possible - ideally, with a totem built only with your own pieces.\n\n",
