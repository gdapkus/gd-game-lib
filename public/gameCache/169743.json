(Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus)&#10;Remove all the scoring reference cards and give one to each player. Put any extra reference cards back in the box.&#10;Shuffle all the small Asteroid cards and deal two to each player. Place the remaining Asteroid cards in a draw deck off to one side of the table within reach of the players.&#10;Shuffle all the larger Moon cards and deal the whole deck out to the players one at a time in clockwise order.&#10;Put the block token (red circle with a line through it) off to one side of the table within reach of the players.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;Quick Play&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;1. Complete the set up&#10;2. All players create a face down three card tableau&#10;3. All players reveal tableaus simultaneously&#10;4. Highest card in tableau gains first player marker (first round only)&#10;5. The first player may play an Asteroid card if he/she wishes&#10;6. First player leads first trick by playing one Moon card&#10;7. In clockwise order from the first player, all other players may play one Asteroid card if they&#10;wish, and then must play one Moon card (must follow suit if able)&#10;8. The player with the highest numbered on-suit card wins the trick and gains a planet token&#10;that matches any suit in his/her tableau&#10;9. The lowest off-suit card wins a token matching the off-suit played (if tied, low off-suits do not get a token)&#10;10. The winner of the trick leads the next trick&#10;11. After all cards have been played, the winner of the most tricks gains 1 planet token of their&#10;choice (does not have to match tableau) &mdash; In the case of a tie, all tied players receive 1&#10;token of choice&#10;12. Players who earned zero tricks may take one token that matches any card in their tableau&#10;13. Pass the first player token to the left (the Earth&rsquo;s moon token) &mdash; the Earth token should&#10;never be moved as it marks the starting point&#10;14. The new first player deals out all cards for the next round and leads the first trick&#10;15. Repeat until all tokens are gone or until all players have dealt one time&#10;&#10;Players score points based on sets of tokens.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IgDprkgrnzAnbs81gWhe9A__original/img/sMcmJNLpICH7z-OMwE77ljfP64w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3224595.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IgDprkgrnzAnbs81gWhe9A__thumb/img/5dgKofK_vBg8qIVWMJ0Vk0ivhQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3224595.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/169743","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"5.78507","averageWeight":"1.5","boardGameRank":"15473","mechanics":["Set Collection","Trick-taking"],"categories":["Card Game","Educational","Space Exploration"],"designers":["Robert Burke"]}}
