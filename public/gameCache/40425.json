On a turn, the player moves their explorer ship, and then, optionally, may discover a tile. Once one player has filled their board everyone else gets one more turn, and then the game ends. Players now score the tiles on their display. Palms, huts, shells, and boats on the tiles influence scoring. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BszYDsADblKsVz1kAAn_8g__original/img/Q66r69_LKfng9mEmsh7ifXc3oAE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic498125.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BszYDsADblKsVz1kAAn_8g__thumb/img/7WU5VcmulO_ujEGFH9-svPw4r2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic498125.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/40425","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
