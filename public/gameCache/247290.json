Every time a new adventurer enters the game by crossing over one of the Anubis statues, the player chooses one of the remaining mission tiles associated with that statue and leaves the rest for the other players.&#10;&#10;Mission tiles award many points, but you have to discard the required tiles. So better be sure if it's worth it!&#10;&#10;Contents: 16 mission tiles&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y5GtbG_5Y0-XJXK2Syt0Mw__original/img/N0NRzZonlzDlBzJvCmyWVhzmvis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4012708.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y5GtbG_5Y0-XJXK2Syt0Mw__thumb/img/5iI7CJUtHNGKF3R1VWuhnEVTXGc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4012708.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/247290","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.10964","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Rüdiger Dorn"]}}
