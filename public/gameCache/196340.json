As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.&#10;&#10;In YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3edsEXwH21uaO8HXXdD1Dg__original/img/O-03BIpt7yhPbsffYjDwZc68zbQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7745916.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3edsEXwH21uaO8HXXdD1Dg__thumb/img/jUrVfOrsWBIaTRd5F6RKHFOYcaQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7745916.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/196340","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.80961","averageWeight":"3.2964","boardGameRank":"144","mechanics":["Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Network and Route Building","Set Collection","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"categories":["Economic"],"designers":["Hisashi Hayashi"]}}
