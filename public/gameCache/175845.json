    "description": "A skirmish game for 2 players by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s.\n\nPlayer, welcome to the Arcade.\n\nYour orders: Command your tank squadron and destroy the enemy. Navigate the labyrinthine arena, and blast the hostile tanks while protecting your own. This is a tactical test of skill. Lose all three tanks, and it's GAME OVER; but if you win, you might just see your initials in the high score list.\n\n",
