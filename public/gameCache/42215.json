During the game, more and more information about the location of a treasure is revealed and its possible locations are gradually narrowed down. When the location of one of the treasures is finally revealed players try to reach it as quickly as possible to secure the findings. The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot.&#10;Players can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.&#10;&#10;The game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__original/img/H3S1YSPe4O54yLV3W4G_zSTIiwU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic596625.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__thumb/img/bfp4x8H9nzQJQyNf2amKyx1BqUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic596625.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/42215","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
