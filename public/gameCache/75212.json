But creating great wine and running a successful vineyard requires much more than just a great location. Patience, dedication, and a good understanding of the market are all needed to be profitable.&#10;&#10;As ambitious vintners, the players attempt to run new vineyards located at the best sites available.

There is a need to observe the cellar and balance long-term strategies against short-term interests for running a successful vineyard.
