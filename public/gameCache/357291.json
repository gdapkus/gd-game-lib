    "description": "The proud, hardy Dwarves are known throughout Middle-earth for their tenacity, strength, and craftsmanship. From the members of the Traveling Company to the noble line of Durin, the Dwarves are a well-known and well-loved part of The Lord of the Rings lore, and now players can bring the strength of these earthen folk to their games of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! Always at home in caves and mines, the Dwarves specialize in delving through their decks to search for treasures and play allies and attachments for fewer resources than usual. Beyond that, they can call upon their Dwarven pride and work together to steamroll any foe!\n\nFor players who are fond of the many Dwarf characters of The Lord of the Rings and their hearty fortitude, they will love the Dwarves of Durin Starter Deck! This expansion comes with a 53-card pre-built deck, giving players the chance to start playing right out of the box.\n\n-description from publisher\n\n",
