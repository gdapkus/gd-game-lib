At the start of the game, each player chooses from Prelude cards that jumpstart the terraforming process or boost their corporation's engine. This expansion also includes 5 new corporations and 7 new project cards that thematically fit the early stages of terraforming a new planet and can be added to the game even if you're not using the Prelude cards; and a new solo mode where your goal is to get to 63 TR before time runs out instead of completing the global parameters.&#10;&#10;Prelude is an expansion to Terraforming Mars, and can be combined with any other Terraforming Mars expansions or variants.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2qrpbgsKEcvu5RLXpb6fgw__original/img/aJDspE-4X4Qyn9ViaBrXd-P7IJw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4137234.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2qrpbgsKEcvu5RLXpb6fgw__thumb/img/D5ierThzC9UcVe3mYB9n0-j5q5w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4137234.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/247030","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"3"}}
