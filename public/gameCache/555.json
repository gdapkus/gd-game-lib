The game includes a variety of professions, such astronomers, organists, and architects; each profession is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom, and players acquire these items via auctions. The more that a player can match these preferences, the more work points they earn &mdash; but the minimum requirement of work points increases each round, and you must meet that threshold in order to convert the work points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GdXWqyTfO8F_M9hFtfo-HA__original/img/832FztQEizwRR3FnHIx1Zgjkw8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7565506.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GdXWqyTfO8F_M9hFtfo-HA__thumb/img/z76c9lnWodF4G-JWPYen5oFj3hs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7565506.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/555","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2000","playingTime":"100","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"100","bestAtCount":"5"}}
