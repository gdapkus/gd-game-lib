    "description": "Step off the stagecoach and into the cursed mining town of Tumbleweed in Disney Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Will you find fortune mining the mysterious mountain &mdash; or awaken its many dangers? Each turn, resources spill down the mountain, with you trying to collect those resources to upgrade your mining operation to score more points. Each round features twist-of-fate cards that mess with the environment through dangers like landslides and dynamite.\n\n",
