    "description": "Cats have very different personalities: Some adorable and sweet, and some...not so much...\n\nThe object of the game is to acquire the best cats. Sometimes, you'll use a dog to chase away unwanted cats, but too many dogs are bad as they will just chase each other!\n\nWith their mice, players attempt to grab the famous Felicity: The Cat In The Sack. In the sack, there are both good and bad cats. Each player can also put a dog or rabbit into the sack instead of a cat, allowing players to bluff one another. At the end of the game, all good cats and mice count as positive points, but bad cats count against you! This is a clever auction game with many interesting decisions.\n\n",
