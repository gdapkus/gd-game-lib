    "description": "&quot;The fasten-ating railway game where the trains are stationery&quot;&#10;&#10;In Paperclip Railways, players initially lay out a fantasy landscape in which to build railway stations; these stations give in- and end-game bonuses and are connected by customizable lengths of track made from paperclips!&#10;&#10;Players score for the stations they build from and to, and for how long their railway links are and, at the end of the game, for various achievements. The player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",
