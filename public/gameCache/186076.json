One player must pick the role of the Sins Player, while the rest are Hero Players. The Hero Players all cooperate with each other, with the Sins Player playing against them all.&#10;&#10;The Apocalypse expansion offers players a whole new play mode, only for the very brave (or very crazy), including the huge and frighteningly detailed figures of War, Pestilence, Famine, Death, and Apocalypse itself.&#10;&#10;This expansion introduces a brand new Apocalypse Track to the game. On this track, instead of drawing new Apocalypse cards as the track advances, new Avatars of the Apocalypse are  brought onto the board, eventually culminating with the appearance of Apocalypse itself.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cB1xJSwJ6-aYXDBEQFuM0w__original/img/jngyNVqn728U04FADCOF_Vk_IbY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3701407.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cB1xJSwJ6-aYXDBEQFuM0w__thumb/img/kmVejcr27zYx6nRTtlIpQ3sY2T0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3701407.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/186076","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[3,5],"averageRating":"7.8952","averageWeight":"3","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Fighting","Horror"],"designers":["Eric M.
