Zombies, Time Travel, Elves, Spaceships &ndash; each has its own special Thematic Conclusion event cards. This game contains all the same wacky fun as Playtest and is compatible with all of the previous expansions in addition to being playable on its own.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw a card and play a card, and you'll keep going until someone wins or everyone loses &ndash; or until the trigger condition of your Thematic Conclusion is met! Games last 1-5 minutes, and any number can play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w6yLjtr20sXh1YcGKLt11w__original/img/2akmkrIutVYVbVfjb0s2djk0WMk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1768469.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w6yLjtr20sXh1YcGKLt11w__thumb/img/Q4XaFpEZpv0up6u6svcUG-A_sLs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1768469.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/147445","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"10","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"1","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":"5"}}
