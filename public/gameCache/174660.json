Build bigger and higher skyscrapers on some of Lower Manhattan's most iconic streets. Raise one of four legendary skyscrapers &mdash; the Park Row, the Singer, the Metropolitan Life, or the majestic Woolworth &mdash; and make one of them the crown jewel of your real estate empire!&#10;&#10;In New York 1901, the players are building skyscrapers on a map of New York's Financial District. Players take location cards from a card's display and then use 2-3 of those location cards to place Tetris-shaped building tiles on the board. They first build bronze level buildings. Later in the game those buildings can be replaced by silver level and gold level buildings.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HTdnmBGtjaS2hgn9IEta9g__original/img/7HYeDu_2vBCepbhAFh1-6eg8WjQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2515532.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HTdnmBGtjaS2hgn9IEta9g__thumb/img/wSOIMKcHyhSA7sU4p9xY2xyj7kA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2515532.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/174660","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
