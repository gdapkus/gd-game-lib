    "description": "Play to tricks following at least one suit while choosing the next to play a vehicle card if they can.  The last to play to each trick crashes!  A crash earns a player points unless it is covered by insurance using a larger card from hand.  Points are bad!  Crash three times and the round ends with a point bonus.  Catastrophe!  Be left with the most unplayed small traffic in your hand and get an even bigger point bonus.  Disaster!\n\n&mdash;description from the designer\n\n",
