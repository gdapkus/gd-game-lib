We see it fly across the screen, racing from right to left across the bright surface of Tatooine, firing its rear lasers, until the shape of its hull is nearly lost behind the glow of its eleven ion turbine engines.&#10;&#10;The iconic Corellian CR90 comes to life in the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game with the Tantive IV Expansion Pack! Featuring one huge, pre-painted CR90 miniature, its maneuver dial, plus all the cards and tokens that you need to field it, the Tantive IV Expansion Pack adds fantastic depth to the game's Cinematic Play and its massive, new Epic Play format. Moreover, rules for &quot;energy&quot; fuel your shields and weapons, and a new maneuver template ensure that the Tantive IV fights and flies in a manner as epic as the ship deserves!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HVWKnKYs9eUk0i20-hQCvQ__original/img/w9Z4jrOhue5U5zo1AGdTbRiVZyo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1955631.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HVWKnKYs9eUk0i20-hQCvQ__thumb/img/RrayrmtjuENqD0iutxRPH2gNwdA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1955631.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/146766","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
