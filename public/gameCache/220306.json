Some are more famous and well known than others. The four newest tracks, specifically designed to enhance Grand Prix, are no different. Adding to the 13 previous series tracks, the Grand Prix Track Pack provides four new tracks based on the most famous F1 courses in the world; Silverstone, Monza, Monaco and Spa-Francorchamps. Each provides new challenges for racers.&#10;&#10;Three of the tracks are designed with just Grand Prix in mind. Monza utilizes the historic oval to create three unique experiences, the oval, the road course, and the monster combined course requiring a trip through the oval after completing a circuit of the road course. Each track can be used for both Grand Prix and Thunder Alley.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bYOAva2Rn7-g7vWOgxkIWQ__original/img/wOZKLPVYk4Xx0lYyhcTl4YUFb3I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7596276.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bYOAva2Rn7-g7vWOgxkIWQ__thumb/img/oajy4e3Iz6RJDUbi8LBCjZCeG0s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7596276.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/220306","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"11","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":null}}
