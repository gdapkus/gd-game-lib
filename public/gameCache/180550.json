Before the game, each player receives a random Secret Trait card.  He must obey the rules on the card, but he cannot reveal it until he meets the conditions from the cards.  Note!  If you are playing with regular Trait cards, one player can have both a Trait card and a Secret Trait card.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7tTUdN2QhVkoLaCdlD5_g__original/img/16qQUjogGXeX4w2zdYDRAW-Klh0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2584373.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7tTUdN2QhVkoLaCdlD5_g__thumb/img/VgawiFh69H-GpEStV7BajtpxsfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2584373.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/180550","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.31071","averageWeight":"1.25","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Adventure","Exploration","Nautical","Novel-based"],"designers":["Ignacy Trzewiczek"]}}
