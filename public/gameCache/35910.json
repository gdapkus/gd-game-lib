    "description": "Settle a deserted island and cannonball your rivals!\n\nIt is the golden age of colonialism and a beautiful deserted island has just been discovered. Unfortunately, ships from different countries have arrived at the same time to claim it!\n\nYou take the role of one of these countries in the fight for supremacy on the island. Build a strategic network of roads and forts to extend your influence. Set up cannons in the right positions to blow away your opponents. The player with the most forts standing at the end of the game wins the island for his country!\n\n",
