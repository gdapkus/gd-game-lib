But a storm is brewing on the horizon, and something foul awaits on a forgotten isle of N&uacute;menor.&#10;&#10;In the Dream-chaser Campaign Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, one to four players sail across the oceans of Middle-earth, battling Corsairs on the high seas and exploring uncharted ruins of N&uacute;menor, all while defending the Grey Havens from fierce raiders. Over the course of nine scenarios&mdash;which can be played standalone or as part of a larger campaign&mdash;the heroes must confront pirates, wraiths, sea monsters, and a persuasive villain who commands a fleet of powerful ships.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes all of the scenarios originally featured in The Grey Havens and the Dream-chaser cycle of content, now repackaged into one box along with all-new campaign content.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/viVJGY08mtSVSLaYa0Mw_Q__original/img/Y9kMcb9yJvRKiWW5Exp6OzdMMXw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7424957.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/viVJGY08mtSVSLaYa0Mw_Q__thumb/img/IlrIeTTpkpY_Mikeftm8x_lU13s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7424957.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/382311","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"1"}}
