The fountain tile is shuffled with the other tiles at the start of the game. If a player rolls two golden masks while on the fountain tile, she recovers one of her lost dice; a player can recover only one lost die during the game.&#10;&#10;This expansion also includes a new pair of curse tiles, with two copies of each curse. &quot;Poison&quot; forces you to lose one die when the first or second countdown ends, even if you're back in the starting chamber; if you're not in the starting chamber, then you lose two dice instead of one. &quot;Strangle vines&quot; forces you to reroll dice showing the adventurer instead of allowing you to keep them while you reroll other dice.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZOWDGl8hhUbUkEwEWrZRiA__original/img/WQ2-C0prOgPM4fgeJVkSBbbgR80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805747.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZOWDGl8hhUbUkEwEWrZRiA__thumb/img/ONr6I0dYYOZXmq-1s0Dx-azmOd4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805747.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149503","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"7.18506","averageWeight":"1.5","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Adventure","Dice","Exploration","Real-time"],"designers":["Kristian Amundsen Østby"]}}
