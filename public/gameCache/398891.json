Unspeakable horrors come in all shapes and sizes, and often the threat they pose can go completely unseen until it is too late. It is up to the brave few with keen intellect, honed survival instincts, or pure dumb luck to face these eldritch perils before they consume us all.&#10;&#10;The Feast of Hemlock Vale Investigator Expansion features five new investigators for Arkham Horror: The Card Game and adds a wealth of new player cards and options for deckbuilding, including brand-new bonded cards and cards that make use of bless and curse tokens. Use the right tool for the job as the handyman, Wilson Richards; build the ultimate laboratory as the scientist, Kate Winthrop; smooth-talk your way out of danger as the countess, Alessandra Zorzi; bring balance to chaos as the folklorist, K&#197;&#141;haku Narukami; and throw yourself into danger to protect others as the farmhand, Hank Samson.&#10;&#10;This expansion is a fantastic addition to any Arkham Horror: The Card Game player&rsquo;s collection, and the cards within can be used to build or enhance investigator decks for any of the game&rsquo;s scenarios or campaigns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B7s_CEg1ks_X6ohCzyKQUA__original/img/C7pbpETZ5w1vTzqA-vM0Irya2mY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8247812.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B7s_CEg1ks_X6ohCzyKQUA__thumb/img/2c8sqVtTvlfxE15llV-1geEcyqE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8247812.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/398891","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2024","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.69216","averageWeight":"4.25","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":[],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Horror"],"designers":["Josiah Harrist","Nicholas Kory"]}}
