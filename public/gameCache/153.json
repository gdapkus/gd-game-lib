The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zlQWc50FPDG44QagA2mfhw__original/img/pPfU3O54II2jM58xqdF3YxMTYUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic586627.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zlQWc50FPDG44QagA2mfhw__thumb/img/OJBg5JO5JIrXzJqArvk9CTz5gzk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic586627.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/153","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1998","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"6.55789","averageWeight":"1.4615","boardGameRank":"2655","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Card Game","Number"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer"]}}
