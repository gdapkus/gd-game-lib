    "description": "In Nekojima, &ldquo;The Island of Cats&rdquo; in Japan, an electricity network is developing to supply the various lively districts of the island. The installation of electric poles becomes more complex due to the narrowness of the territory and its curious population of cats strolling on the cables.&#10;&#10;Nekojima is a wooden game of skill and dexterity in which you have to keep an entire installation in balance. Players take turns placing or stacking denchuu &mdash; &#233;&#155;&#187;&#230;&#159;&#177;, or electrical poles &mdash; respecting the locations without any hanging cables touching. Be careful not to be the one to bring down the structure. This game requires reflection, concentration and skill.&#10;&#10;In competitive mode, the player who knocks down the structure loses.&#10;In cooperative mode, the goal is to go as far as possible.&#10;&#10;AWARDS:&#10;&#10;2023 - SWISS Gamers Award Family&#10;2023 - Major Fun Award&#10;2022 - 1st prize Alchimie in Toulouse&#10;2022 - 1st prize Pari Ludique in Paris&#10;2022 - Special Jury Prize at the FLIP in Parthenay&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
