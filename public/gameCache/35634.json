A village (awarding its indicated shape tokens) is scored when 4 cards surround the sides. A new village is placed when two different players cards create a location for it to be placed. The game uses &quot;Knizia&quot; style scoring, where having a dominating majority in a single shape category merely qualifies you for the win, but it is your total in the other two shapes which are compared for winning.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wVb3E8srr6Daz17vKQZssw__original/img/BMPdIr6IRGC7knToOFG8DxxtuTE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic552609.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wVb3E8srr6Daz17vKQZssw__thumb/img/6wOlCp2I1VeXreuEdaKREYZ0z08=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic552609.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/35634","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
