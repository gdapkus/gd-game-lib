When setting up the game, place the volcanic island tile in the central playing area, then place one gold tile face down on each marked space on this tile. Whenever someone builds over one of these tiles, they reveal the number on the tile and immediately receives that much gold.&#10;&#10;Confirmed by Stefan Feld: &quot;The volcano island tile is a tile with 4 islands separated by a volcano (instead of water).&#10;You can&acute;t build on the volcano space.&quot;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wdv57nOI-pR5y-Dgp96HmA__original/img/zluvvYueHeLSLzAG88YwlQxuwWs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805718.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wdv57nOI-pR5y-Dgp96HmA__thumb/img/dOObYf8ErB3S8C74f-bVwtVA0Wo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805718.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/149273","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"75","minPlayingTime":"75","maxPlayingTime":"75","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"7.25218","averageWeight":"2.8","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Nautical","Renaissance"],"designers":["Stefan Feld"]}}
