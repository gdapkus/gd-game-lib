Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.&#10;&#10;Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.&#10;&#10;In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.&#10;&#10;According to Wallace, &quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time. The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other.&quot;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F1DJ5wsTySoSTTb9E3fouQ__original/img/5cgNo6iXR7kouxeYkWYrZmtvzCg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic715611.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F1DJ5wsTySoSTTb9E3fouQ__thumb/img/BpkzyXVeVxZVBmac2jam5LfI4Fg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic715611.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/65901","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
