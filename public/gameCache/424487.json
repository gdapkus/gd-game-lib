    "description": "It&rsquo;s a party to die for!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s the dead of winter, and Arkham&rsquo;s social elite have arrived in mist-shrouded Kingsport for an exquisite gala hosted by the enigmatic Lantern Club. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t take long before nightmarish creatures crash the festivities, and it falls to you to uncover the Club&rsquo;s dark schemes before Arkham&rsquo;s most powerful leaders all meet a terrible fate!&#10;&#10;In The Midwinter Gala, one to four investigators ally with a faction of their choice and work together to claim the powerful relic at the center of the Lantern Club&rsquo;s nefarious plot. The scenario can be played on its own or inserted into any campaign as a side-story, and it can also be played semi-competitively between multiple teams of investigators!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
