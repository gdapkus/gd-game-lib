    "description": "Dungeon Fighter: The Big Wave is the second of four expansions for use with Dungeon Fighter, each themed to one of the four elements: air, earth, wind and fire.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes new monsters and equipment, a new pirate hero, new maps with special rooms, and Cthulhu as the Boss. As in a fantasy role-playing game, players can accumulate experience points, then use them for power cards that allow for devastating water powers, such as the &quot;Major Healing&quot; spell &mdash; but beware the new monster choking ability! You'll have to fight them off by using the three small elemental dice to make new &quot;impossible&quot; die rolls...&#10;&#10;",
