Before you can escape, you&rsquo;ll need to solve whatever challenges you encounter within the city. You may need to confront a large horde of zombies, escort your elderly grandfather from the retirement home to the safety of the church, or even clear a barricade blocking your path. &#10;Alternatively, you may add unique characters to the game with the second module included in The Survivor Chronicles.
