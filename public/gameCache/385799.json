    "description": "After hiking a local trail, you and your partner have returned to a campsite completely ransacked by pesky critters. Team up to clear your campground of critters before your neighbors. Scram! is a fun & fast team based card game that plays 1 vs 2, 2 vs 2 & 3 vs 3!\n\nEach animal has a different card value, and many have a special action. Be careful, there may be critters who are still hiding and waiting for the right moment to present themselves!\n\nCall out &ldquo;Scram!\" when you think your team has the fewest animals in your campsite; but will your team be able to toss out the troublesome trespassers before your neighbors?\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
