All the animals flee in terror! Well, not really. Only a dumb animal would call attention to itself. In our forest, the animals are smart, otherwise their heads would be decorating the hunter&rsquo;s mantelpiece. Our animals just casually saunter away, while convincing the hunter that he must be looking for something else. &ldquo;Are you hungry for rabbit, Mr. Hunter? Well, you see, I&rsquo;m a moose. Oh, no, not a moose with antlers like that&hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In this merry game, players take on the roles of rabbits and moose. While the hunter strolls through the forest, players are trying to look like an animal the hunter won&rsquo;t shoot. And because they do so by making rabbit ears or moose antlers of various shapes on their heads, the spectators enjoy the game as well as the players.&#10;&#10;Game contents&#10;&#10;6 player cards (1 in each color)&#10;15 trail cards&#10;111 scoring cards&#10;12 figures (1 rabbit and 1 moose in each color)&#10;1 sheet with a poem on each side&#10;1 rules&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VYyr18_uGpO7US7gAs-3Pw__original/img/qmjAQE3tgB8pgOrpH5VfePTeniU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic581352.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VYyr18_uGpO7US7gAs-3Pw__thumb/img/P9OdcpdY6IYI4V_oOKEtJudp0Hw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic581352.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/59149","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[5,6],"averageRating":"6.04507","averageWeight":"1.5273","boardGameRank":"6318","mechanics":["Acting","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"categories":["Action / Dexterity","Animals","Humor","Party Game"],"designers":["Vlaada Chv√°til"]}}
