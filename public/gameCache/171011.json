Once any player gains the Queen's influence, a final contest occurs for the Pharaoh's favor.&#10;&#10;Favor of the Pharaoh tasks players with building a dice-rolling engine&mdash;not to mention adding and manipulating dice&mdash;in preparation for a final roll-off between all players to gain the Pharaoh's favor and win the game.&#10;&#10;Favor of the Pharaoh includes more than one hundred tiles, over twenty standard and custom dice, dozens of bonus tokens, level bars, locking pyramids, and more. With so many combinations of level bars and tiles, no two games will ever be set up the same!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/coLyFKqzvTR883sVXD2-oQ__original/img/PjI7ofDabemcMtaZK5T818_XA7c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2408447.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/coLyFKqzvTR883sVXD2-oQ__thumb/img/hP9yWxjsAVOqcx34n9mpMh7y_t4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2408447.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/171011","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.78709","averageWeight":"2.0127","boardGameRank":"1912","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Re-rolling and Locking"],"categories":["Dice"],"designers":["Thomas Lehmann"]}}
