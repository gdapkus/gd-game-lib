At the start of the game, each player chooses a class deck and a race deck, then shuffles them together to create unique character combinations, such as a Human Paladin or Goblin Druid. Each combination creates unique tactics and strategies to use when you battle.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing them to zero life. Players do this by playing moves that act as both attacks and blocks as well as with special cards and abilities granted by the player's choice of class and race.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player adds cards to their &quot;aggression pile&quot;, then chooses how many cards to draw from their aggression pile into their hand. The player uses the aggression provided by the cards that remain in their aggression pile to play move cards to block incoming enemy attacks. If an attack isn't blocked, the player takes damage, specifically one damage per unblocked enemy attack. Then all the moves played by that player become attacks for the opponent to deal with on the opponent's next turn. There's more to it than that, but those are the basics...&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNoA8cCSxEbYCL6ilXbYVA__original/img/PV8wQ4wXVg9Mdzavn2POSWLOZto=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2376384.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNoA8cCSxEbYCL6ilXbYVA__thumb/img/wRXqfvvmSDQegKtSey9rp9CweKs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2376384.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/168770","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"2"}}
