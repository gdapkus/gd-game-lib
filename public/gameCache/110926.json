Now, not only do you have to place them as just described, but in addition, the tiles always need to be connected - directly or indirectly (i.e. by the same color) with at least one castle.&#10;&#10;In other words: If you add a new tile, it must lie either directly next to a castle - or at least be connected with a castle by the same color (as the tile); a different color is not allowed.&#10;&#10;This rule doesn't apply to new castles; they may be added as before.&#10;&#10;At any time, for the cost of both dice actions and 5 victory points, a player may retrieve a previously set-aside (that was unclaimed/purchased from the main board in a previous round) Castle tile (Green or Black-backed) and place it in their reserve.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r1c4NZ3XMBXQPdX3ALK_vw__original/img/CIwCOaslDZFwxN76tpdyX1qPeM0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1122959.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r1c4NZ3XMBXQPdX3ALK_vw__thumb/img/ire7syxHKjgoNt9TK9Y6btdrSzU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1122959.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/110926","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.93322","averageWeight":"2.8889","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Dice","Medieval","Territory Building"],"designers":["Stefan Feld"]}}
