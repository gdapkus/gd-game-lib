Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/1WL5-4DZi0hX76HEgsLIYRRaIh4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4837710.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/247763","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"150","minPlayingTime":"80","maxPlayingTime":"150","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.05576","averageWeight":"3.5834","boardGameRank":"44","mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Income","Network and Route Building","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Claim Action","Turn Order: Stat-Based","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Card Game","City Building","Civilization","Industry / Manufacturing","Nautical","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Vladimír Suchý"]}}
