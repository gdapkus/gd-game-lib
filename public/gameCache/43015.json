After controlling a line between two cities with your pawns, you can decide to build an office (and maybe also establish control and/or get a bonus marker) or to get a skill improvement from some of the cities.&#10;&#10;Players have to improve their traders' &quot;skills&quot; for the following effects: getting more VP from offices in their network, getting more available action points, increasing the number of available pawns, and getting the right to place pawns and get more special pawns.&#10;&#10;This game appeared originally as Wettstreit der H&auml;ndler at the Hippodice competition.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__original/img/RqYxJUdNXPmHUWrlADIbTf9Bi_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic839090.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__thumb/img/4350nWgj6kTrn8BWFI6cxvts_E0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic839090.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/43015","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"7.74193","averageWeight":"3.0952","boardGameRank":"136","mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","End Game Bonuses","Network and Route Building","Ownership","Take That","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks"],"categories":["Medieval"],"designers":["Andreas Steding"]}}
