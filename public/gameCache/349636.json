After shuffling them, distribute them randomly to the players and each takes the matching Special Sponsor tile. Each player must put their Sponsor tile on their Sponsor card. To activate these tiles, when the player chooses a Delivery, they may immediately discard one of the Project tiles they just acquired to immediately use their Special Sponsor tile.&#10;&#10;The new special sponsor tiles are:&#10;&#10;Moon Paradise Real Estate: This tile is placed on the table next to a Building Site on one of the player&rsquo;s cards that has already been placed (thereby &ldquo;enlarging&rdquo; the settlement). Later, the player may place any Project tile on top of it as though it were an empty site. However, it cannot be moved and no Construction card can be placed on top of it. It does not affect any of the restrictions regarding the placement of cards.&#10;&#10;LUNA Taxis: When a player places this tile in their Settlement, they may move one of the Project tiles they have already placed to any other empty site in their Settlement, in accordance with the standard placement rules.&#10;&#10;Astroburger: When a player places this tile in their Settlement, they may reserve one of the Project tiles that they have taken this turn by putting it on their Sponsor card. They may then place that tile in their Settlement during any subsequent turn, after choosing their Delivery.&#10;&#10;Space Royal Cruise: When a player places this tile in their Settlement, they may choose a Construction card in one of the 4 Deliveries and put it into their hand*. Replace the removed card with the top card from the deck.&#10;&#10;*NOTE: The printed rules are translated incorrectly to &quot;and place it at the bottom of the deck&quot;.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BhwwVibFYESkhJG1DCh0zA__original/img/BPq8-2lWiyTZpdngOmt9RjcsTxw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7262520.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BhwwVibFYESkhJG1DCh0zA__thumb/img/8U1ZGQds3FUKXUBey8ywlp6UZ90=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7262520.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/349636","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null}}
