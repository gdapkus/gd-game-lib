This is an expansion pack, so you will need the Power Grid game to play with it. As with the original, the board has a different map on each side: France and Italy. Along with the maps are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two countries. France, a land that has embraced nuclear power, has an earlier start with atomic plants and more uranium available. Italy has more waste, but fewer coal and oil resources. The result is not just new maps, but new ways to play this great game!&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;     Power Grid&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xApaaV3xEdtqiJSrfmSrPQ__original/img/f74G_F7q1Oiot4w_LrVqHdj0q2s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1553323.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xApaaV3xEdtqiJSrfmSrPQ__thumb/img/Qm-NjpXp64Oqb7v3Fv_hYsIOXyo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1553323.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/19319","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2005","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"7.91385","averageWeight":"3.2915","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Income","Market","Network and Route Building"],"categories":["Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["Friedemann Friese"]}}
