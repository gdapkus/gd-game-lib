Players take control of Nikola Tesla or Thomas Edison and build a company that claims projects in regions around the United States, advance the latest technologies, engage in a propaganda war around AC and DC technologies, and buy stock shares in smaller electricity companies. During the game, players bring famous luminaries of the time that each offer unique actions and abilities into their company. The winner is the company that wins two of the three main systems: controlling regions with projects, being ahead in the PR race, and holding the most valuable stock portfolio. Tesla and Edison each have a special auto-win condition that players can trigger during the game to win right away.&#10;&#10;While Tesla vs. Edison: Duel has all of the aspects introduced in the larger Tesla vs. Edison game, it is designed for light-to-medium weight gamers to enjoy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CotK7I4cOYZlss2h8QRLJw__original/img/E0sld1OmPT2vZW1dzvgmyaoX7DA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3644734.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CotK7I4cOYZlss2h8QRLJw__thumb/img/Gf1F_khlpRboCYzeWq0YGFejhKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3644734.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/224125","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"2"}}
