Now your humble inn has drawn the attention of an ancient wyrm. Pay close attention to who leaves and who stays: if your departing Patrons irritate the lurking Dragon, all your hard work is sure to go up in flames!&#10;&#10;Each game using the Local Dragons expansion adds 1 of 3 possible Dragons to your Inn. As Patrons leave, check their symbols to see whether they provoke the Dragon. If the Dragon is sufficiently provoked -- two matching symbols accumulated -- you&rsquo;ll lose the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-EYx5tyaK9LssuYJPkFWXQ__original/img/9ZDHOEfn1OERFi-jOw5QMzOFfgA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5841364.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-EYx5tyaK9LssuYJPkFWXQ__thumb/img/x2zjQlCyEKmLWPRw2KONNlYfImU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841364.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/326277","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","yearPublished":"2021","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[1],"averageRating":"6.55393","averageWeight":"0","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Solo / Solitaire Game"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Card Game","Print & Play"],"designers":["Scott Almes"]}}
