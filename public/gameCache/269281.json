Later, when buying a building, you may return a boat to the center to help pay for the building.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-AQRux8pKzEgPJLJYny93Q__original/img/f4zCVMV-XhLvBd_5pkQtnAvOPVg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4513147.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-AQRux8pKzEgPJLJYny93Q__thumb/img/euBzZIZjvRQ8azYROYjz6lkJ6Jo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4513147.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/269281","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
