I see you&rsquo;ve only got one ship stationed on this here planet of ours. Well, around here we call that vagrancy, and it&rsquo;s illegal. So I&rsquo;m sorry sir, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to have to write you a ticket.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The galaxy of Cosmic Encounter, like most galaxies, is constantly changing. Just when you think you&rsquo;ve explored every corner of it and met most of its aliens, you turn around to find that a new star system has just materialized, full of new species with astonishing, wildly unique customs. You&rsquo;ve learned that when interacting with a strange alien for the first time, its best not to reveal all of your hand at once. If you want to establish colonies in these recently-formed parts of the galaxy, you&rsquo;ll have to be conceal your true intentions, negotiate with cunning, and be careful not to put your foot into cross-cultural quicksand&mdash;or into your mouth.&#10;&#10;Cosmic Eons, an expansion for Cosmic Encounter, introduces new aliens with abilities unlike any you&rsquo;ve dealt with so far, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. This expansion features the Hidden Alliances variant, which enables you and your opponents to reveal simultaneously whose side you&rsquo;re on. With this simple mechanical twist, Cosmic Eons promises not just to open up a new part of the galaxy, but to change how you play the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yaamOKLb8qlBHbvlQ_rzXw__original/img/i_a3467juR5bb3nLItDSUv1TQ_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3143191.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yaamOKLb8qlBHbvlQ_rzXw__thumb/img/RK3zFGV0pCiqjUE-c6SzcZqvqOE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3143191.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/206366","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"8.34171","averageWeight":"3.25","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Bluffing","Expansion for Base-game","Negotiation","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Bill Eberle","Peter Olotka","Greg Olotka"]}}
