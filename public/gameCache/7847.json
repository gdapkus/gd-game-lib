The Soviets were not equipped however, for a war in sub-zero temperatures against an enemy capable of living off the land &amp; moving swiftly over the snow. Now you can re-fight one of World War II's most dramatic engagements in Blood On The Snow.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the game box:&#10;&#10;&quot;At the beginning of each day, players determine the weather, select a number of operation chits, and place them in a common cup.
