Then, each player takes turns and adds (gingerly) a bean to the top-heavy pot.  Eventually, the pot will tip over and spill the beans.  Whoever causes this adds the beans to his store.  The object is to go out.&#10;&#10;Simple, quick, fun little game, requiring a minimum of dexterity.&#10;&#10;Schaper was bought out by Milton Bradley in 1986 (or MB acquired the rights to most of Schaper's games, I'm not sure), and this game has been published by MB ever since.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ueC_H21GlTPZHSHO2Zn9lA__original/img/4KftKhpIEBCwQVCn0ddeZd4PXSc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic54286.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ueC_H21GlTPZHSHO2Zn9lA__thumb/img/zyjxEFz8SxakSbwcEvaBTOKToFk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic54286.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5015","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1957","playingTime":"10","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"10","bestAtCount":"2"}}
