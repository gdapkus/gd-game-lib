    "description": "Steam: Map Expansion #2 provides three maps in the same pack that can be used with the Steam base game. One side of the four-panel game board features a map of Great Britain suitable for 3-4 players that's subtitled \"Progress from Canals to Rails\". The other side of the game board has two maps, each covering two panels of the game board: California 2090 (\"Gain Prestige but Prepare for Disaster\" for three players) and China (\"Unite the Country on the Floodplains\" for 2-4 players).\n\nSteam: Map Expansion #2 also includes an extra tile sheet for Steam.\n\n",
