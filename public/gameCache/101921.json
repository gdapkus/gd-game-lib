Designed by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Elder Sign), Season of the Witch is a single-scenario expansion that sends players on a tense and terrifying race against the clock.&#10;&#10;There are no new mechanics added in this expansion; it is purely an additional scenario for the base game that will use the modular board setup from Mansions of Madness.  The setup of this scenario will be dictated by the included event cards and reference sheets.&#10;&#10;In this macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players, each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.&#10; (Note: variations in printing mean that cards from Print on Demand expansions will be subtly different in appearance and texture from base game cards. Therefore, any necessary base game cards (such as the &ldquo;nothing of interest&rdquo; Exploration cards) will be reprinted in each expansion, to retain a consistent appearance when shuffled.)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T-VXTePNrQUJoUSGpMLvrw__original/img/66Mmyo_NMIUYEHHPLRqvcM9MAvI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1055726.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T-VXTePNrQUJoUSGpMLvrw__thumb/img/WgQ6I5Ttg1Rif2ZsJUStENBnWf8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1055726.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/101921","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2011","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"7.53253","averageWeight":"2.8293","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Pick-up and Deliver","Role Playing","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Expansion for Base-game","Exploration","Horror","Miniatures","Murder / Mystery","Puzzle","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Launius"]}}
