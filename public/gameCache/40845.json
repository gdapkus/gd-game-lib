Naturally this expansion fits only the Keltis version.&#10;For this expansion you need everything from the basic game but the board and the tokens. This new board provides new challenges and requires new ways of thinking. The new gameboard is arranged portrait-style rather than the landscape orientation of the original, and the five roads have been replaced by a network of intersecting and overlapping roads, so you can continue on a different color or even choose which way to go. The point values also change during your way, not simply increasing.&#10;Also  you have 5 cairns on the board, with each cairn having a stack of five stones in a particular color. When you reach a spot on that track, you claim the top stone. Stones of all five colors are awarded 10 points; collecting three stones of the same color is also worth 10 points, too.&#10;&#10;This expansion is included in the 2012 edition of Keltis.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gwqhEjxRqdavZYx81oql3A__original/img/-BjEWYypjFzrue_-qsbftMjHjzo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic446316.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gwqhEjxRqdavZYx81oql3A__thumb/img/0vBrf-xzaRiJapOmhJdHMSXS79Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic446316.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/40845","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.12689","averageWeight":"2.0857","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Set Collection"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"]}}
