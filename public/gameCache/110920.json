As long as it is next to the game board it can be claimed by discarding different-colored craftsman tiles. Immediately after another player has carried out &quot;Purchase equipment or commissions&quot; action in a city, you may, out of turn, immediately buy the topmost commission or equipment card in that city (card costs are as normal). The game then continues as normal with next player whose turn was interrupted taking his turn.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9yRMJZ_CkW4Ye-6Gk56UwA__original/img/us8MZxEFQo4ROZirxDAvz3Gw-P0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1123791.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9yRMJZ_CkW4Ye-6Gk56UwA__thumb/img/x7d5EsODi7ut18qtcKI9g_C7YMY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1123791.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/110920","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"4"}}
