Yet no grave can contain the evil forces of Angmar, which lurk in wild and ancient places, stretching the valorous D&uacute;nedain rangers far and thin in their duty to protect the land.&#10;&#10;In the Angmar Awakened Campaign Expansion, one to four players join forces with the D&uacute;nedain to defend Eriador and investigate the source of the evil that plagues the land. Across nine scenarios, playable over the course of a sequential campaign, they must confront Orcs, trolls, wraiths, and a cunning villain who wields dark sorcery.&#10;&#10;This expansion includes all of the scenarios featured in The Lost Realm and the original Angmar Awakened cycle, now repackaged into one box, along with all-new campaign content.&#10;&#10;This expansion is for the revised edition of the base game but is fully compatible with the original core set.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1wQvps4IBDFYJMuyw3SZ5A__original/img/IZhiIxIlXKt1HOTSHQnOzRREgI4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6771062.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1wQvps4IBDFYJMuyw3SZ5A__thumb/img/kshmileZEMqWoXkyxxaxNFFhavg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6771062.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/359421","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
