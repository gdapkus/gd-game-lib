Art for this expansion is by Klemens Franz, the same artist who did the work for Agricola.&#10;&#10;The aliens arrive when the players create a Quarry; that is, when the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card from Stage II of the game (Rounds 5-7) is revealed. Whenever a player takes this action, they also draw the top card from the Alien Encounter Deck (X Deck). (Note that this does not apply to the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card that appears during Stage IV (Rounds 10-11).) Of course, you also take any Stone that is on the space.&#10;&#10;An English edition of this expansion has been available directly from Lookout Games and can be obtained by donating to a fundraiser via PayPal. It is also available via Agricola: The Goodies Expansion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gzB86jTjCmoRdW16X75FvQ__original/img/VK2WMFQwmnrBry8Ki2cjrZV1BIw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic445726.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gzB86jTjCmoRdW16X75FvQ__thumb/img/gaFeMZcRU7tqcbgZf1CqU2r9APM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic445726.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/38733","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[3,5],"averageRating":"6.20889","averageWeight":"2.5217","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Worker Placement"],"categories":["Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Farming","Science Fiction"],"designers":["David Fair","Hanno Girke","John Kennard","Larry Levy","Fraser McHarg","Melissa Rogerson","Dale Yu"]}}
