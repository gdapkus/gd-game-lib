The players represent fantasy characters on a path through a land full of adventure with the goal of grabbing ancient artifacts from the claws of demons guarding the surrounding astral realms.&#10;&#10;Instead of rolling dice to move around the game board, players in Prophecy use a variety of means of transport. The game includes an experience system and loads of skills and spells that your character can learn. A large number of monsters that you can meet and fight also await you, as do random events that will keep taxing your abilities because after you cast a spell or lose a fight, your strength or willpower declines until it is recharged by healing.&#10;&#10;Whoever holds four of the five hidden artifacts wins the game and becomes the next king of the land.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;      Prophecy: Dragon Realm (2003)&#10;      Prophecy: Water Realm (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdxA5PUDzdCk5NH2T_SuwQ__original/img/mPp8WD5Hgd-xu9L_LI39jLg6BPk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1919190.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdxA5PUDzdCk5NH2T_SuwQ__thumb/img/b0cUN2oY30xhUXGZQ1-oO2AI74c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1919190.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8095","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2002","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"180","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":"3"}}
