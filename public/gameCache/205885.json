If a row is full, then whoever played that final card takes all of the cards already in the row, scoring negative points for all of the bullheads on those cards.&#10;&#10;X nimmt! changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.&#10;&#10;All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.&#10;&#10;A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.&#10;&#10;This game was called Take A Number when included in the two game set Take 5 & Take A Number.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uSz1S0vlBzK9hsgC5WLKxw__original/img/2IV5gkZF8Y7qjn7Kwsx7o4DAGRQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3126004.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uSz1S0vlBzK9hsgC5WLKxw__thumb/img/OEJ9nB1Eof-B5bbyujYfzj26AZM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3126004.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/205885","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"25","minPlayingTime":"25","maxPlayingTime":"25","bestAtCount":"2"}}
