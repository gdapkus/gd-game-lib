Players take actions such as contracting workers, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.&#10;&#10;There are several lands that, once sailed to, allow players to found colonies. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining their privileges with their achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__original/img/Bfuphp_LyNR24k8Y4wLXjeUDdNs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3246725.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__thumb/img/H49jq0-D4ceSoqO2c3ZGiNfkOH8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3246725.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66589","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"4"}}
