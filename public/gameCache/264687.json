    "description": "The Terran territories were not the first targets of Janusian invasion. The alien menace has enveloped and consumed over a dozen previous civilizations as its titanic fleet edged along through the galaxies. Survivors of these conquests hate the Janusians almost more than Terrans do &ndash; which is why it came as no shock when a pair of aliens arrived planetside and offered their help to Project: ELITE. Two esteemed members of the elite within the Plu&rsquo;htonian royalty, Royal Envoy Apollo and Duchess Aloria, have come to Earth to help deal defeat to the Janusians &ndash; just as their people did decades ago. It might come at a price down the road, but for now, any help is good help in such a dark hour. The ELITEs need all the help they can get defending humanity, even if it comes from beyond the stars.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
