Each player assumes a secret mask with hidden VP-bonus and sends out a &quot;dancer&quot; to fulfill various functions at 6 different &quot;stages&quot; (or rather &quot;adventure places&quot;). Players can try to accumulate spell cards, heal, trigger events, fight monsters for treasure, or fight other players for VP's. The spell cards are musically themed with names like &quot;Nocturne&quot; or &quot;Fugue&quot;.&#10;The game uses a small deck of (very sturdy) cards, and the assortment of game elements allows for a variety of strategies. Although the game utilizes relatively few luck elements, it becomes chaotic through the many different effects of the cards and the variable dancer powers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vaPLMvcyCRXKg3lQBVQBhA__original/img/QVTPJWCr1IAvSEzoZzjPAGDTqO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic229572.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vaPLMvcyCRXKg3lQBVQBhA__thumb/img/wDhvCO-_N9OzUvr8wuZc-5E-TAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic229572.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/9108","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"6.01414","averageWeight":"2.2903","boardGameRank":"10252","mechanics":["Hand Management","Open Drafting","Role Playing","Variable Phase Order","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Adventure","Card Game","Deduction","Fantasy","Fighting","Music"],"designers":["Satoshi Nakamura"]}}
