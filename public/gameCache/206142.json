Navigate your way through the treacherous mists, building your strength and increasing your influence, until you can finally defeat the monster. Or perhaps politely ask it to go away?&#10;&#10;Deep Fog is a bonus scenario for Islebound, which includes one 2-sided card and an instruction sheet. As the rules explain succinctly, &quot;With Deep Fog, players navigate through a rotating stack of sea boards instead of laying them out in a fixed map. The game ends when a player is able to defeat the fog monster, either through military prowess or diplomacy.&quot;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7LMpw0nryvPGSLcV3yZ7Q__original/img/uYxV1dHmoKRKvG235JYz0PHRTto=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3131675.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7LMpw0nryvPGSLcV3yZ7Q__thumb/img/v9pXPshBVOvZLjWs3jQLjY8P2bs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3131675.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/206142","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":"2"}}
