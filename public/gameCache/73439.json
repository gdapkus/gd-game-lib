Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them &mdash; anything for more fame!&#10;&#10;Make your underlings:&#10;&#10;&#10;     work on the cathedral&#10;     combat misfortune&#10;     bustle about the city&#10;     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Many editions of Troyes released in 2016 or later include rules for a solo variant as well as four bonus cards originally released in 2011 as a promotional item. Versions released prior to this date contain rules only for games with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__original/img/otcIVdG4ebZmK1SjUtzma18JtJ4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic750583.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__thumb/img/Npv5mrWBkjnlKjl_8hGLNk9CCwc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic750583.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/73439","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"3"}}
