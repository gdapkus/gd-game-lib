The auction was won by Aaron Cappochi. He decided which animals to include on the bonus tile (elephants and zebras). He was also involved in the design process with us in relation to the game effect of the animals. We had an extremely tight timescale to get this done for Essen 2009 and enormous credit and thanks go to Aaron for his contribution. If you are blocked by an elephant blame him ;-)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mn8xLg4bHiLQxYtSsyF3eg__original/img/clB3pNR_9nqDfhoeTEPZSsvXN4Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic589562.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mn8xLg4bHiLQxYtSsyF3eg__thumb/img/gdlAQTWcuwfD9qZ1H2FexXjpO-g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic589562.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/60077","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":null}}
