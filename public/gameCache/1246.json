Players design a mutant bug team and with them attempt to escape from &quot;The Hive,&quot; filled with real-world arthropods and controlled by an adversarial &quot;Hivemaster&quot; player (somewhat akin to a dungeonmaster).  The game comes with 16 mutant bug displays (6 are &quot;starting&quot; displays, the others are swapped in as the bugs mutate), design cards, mapsheets, minature bugs and counters.&#10;&#10;A limited reissue of the game, The Mutant Kit, was published in 2000 without rubber bugs or Hive cards, creating a modular game system that could be combined with other expansions.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Insecta: Rainforest&#10;    Insecta: Trilobite&#10;    Insecta: Desert Hive&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sqR2uC4P8l1z7Nz13HkHw__original/img/v2A2ZZ9KBXClboV4GaRFnMEBqZE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic315948.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sqR2uC4P8l1z7Nz13HkHw__thumb/img/6zJtJ_8K3wyVnhX6nmiGqn14pbM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic315948.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1246","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"1992","playingTime":"300","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"300","bestAtCount":"1"}}
