What's more, each monster comes with its own set of eight Evolution cards &ndash; first introduced in King of Tokyo: Power Up! &ndash; so that each monster can mutate into an even more nightmarish version of itself!&#10;&#10;King of Tokyo: Halloween also includes six orange-and-black engraved dice (to fit the Halloween theme, of course) and twelve new Power cards to be shuffled into the deck. These cards are all Costumes, a new type of card that provides a powerful effect, but which can be stolen by any monster that rolls three claws and rips the costume off of you.&#10;&#10;The first edition of King of Tokyo: Halloween included an exclusive promotional card for the standalone game King of New York, which debuted in 2014.&#10;&#10;Part of the King of Tokyo series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QjwNUQRiBv2uBKqg1pPtHg__original/img/EK0PAKH5RiG1KRh38MSsbIevUcg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3616670.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QjwNUQRiBv2uBKqg1pPtHg__thumb/img/6cNbw0WeQAZ8bHFQOAnQHYrcfdY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3616670.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/147183","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
