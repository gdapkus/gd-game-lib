In either case, you want to complete your harvest as efficiently as possible to earn the most coins.&#10;&#10;Players can bet and win more coins by correctly predicting the outcome (success or failure) of their opponents&rsquo; efforts to assemble their harvest, so players stay involved and engaged in the game even when it is not their turn!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DMXnaqbU_TKfYmDPHHyfHg__original/img/m2snoz5O6KsxEbqgizWYmf7aZho=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic608828.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DMXnaqbU_TKfYmDPHHyfHg__thumb/img/ziKmt4rXHYoxtMYkFWfXoTS3MLw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic608828.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/62343","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[5],"averageRating":"5.82541","averageWeight":"1.4286","boardGameRank":"13996","mechanics":["Betting and Bluffing","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"categories":["Farming"],"designers":["Carlo A.
