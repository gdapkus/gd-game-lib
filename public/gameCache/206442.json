For the site with the most stones, the player occupying the first space below this site on the card (the space on the left) receives 5 points, and the player on the second space receives 3 points. For the site with the second most stones, the player occupying the first space below it receives 3 points, and the player on the second space receives 0 points.

If multiple sites tie for the second most stones, they receive 0 points.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejBemFyHFTVWaGx-waNxBA__original/img/2OtcdmG_TiE-mN2Ql8QsUH9s_Wk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3134584.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejBemFyHFTVWaGx-waNxBA__thumb/img/PlTVpuPk-jsAnGipnx5Yw6aEtRc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3134584.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/206442","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2016","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":"4"}}
