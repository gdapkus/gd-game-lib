Become the leader of one of four rival nations: the industrious humans, the toad engineers, the scholarly Cresarians, or the clever hogmen.  Produce goods like machine parts and bottled demons to gain wealth, or research steam-age technology and recruit mercenaries to control the continent. If you want to establish new cities, you&rsquo;ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands. Your cities have limited capacity, so you&rsquo;ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures.  The future of a nation is in your hands. Build unbreakable foundations for an empire or disappear into the dusty pages of history.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build a civilization in a Steampunk setting&#10;    Customize two decks of cards in a unique twist on deck-building&#10;    Choose your path- build a powerful economy or conquer everything in sight&#10;    Includes hundreds of lavishly-illustrated cards, an extra-large board, land boards, coin tokens, and more&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FbHx0yxHQlzOqsh50WZGOg__original/img/EEjbxoJbuGtd0-eL3OE42YS4Nxw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1292441.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FbHx0yxHQlzOqsh50WZGOg__thumb/img/y1UNy7m9AdM5-cUVVRGlMQCZbBI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1292441.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/123499","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
