I want to see you create three potions, by mixing the required ingredients. And this time, let's try not to burn anyones eyebrows off...&#10;&#10;Using just Earth, Fire and Water you can create anything, but watch out for any explosive combinations!&#10;&#10;Potions Class is a game of explosive family fun as 2 players race to be the first to brew 3 magical potions.  Each turn players will draw 3 cards, one at a time.  After each card is drawn they must choose to place it on a potion, in their reserve, or in their opponent's reserve.  They must place 1 card in each location, but be careful!  Putting the wrong card in your opponents reserve may give them just the right ingredient they need to complete their 3rd potion and conjure up the victory!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nSdEY4yDRfnQX38JYzi9Xg__original/img/4c21SLrv7_pRfl-PX7z2s3t6Wl8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4973525.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nSdEY4yDRfnQX38JYzi9Xg__thumb/img/Ms7J3x5I6LiU3K5Wbp18qFNIQ-g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4973525.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/260322","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"15","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"15","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.09575","averageWeight":"1","boardGameRank":"15298","mechanics":["Hand Management","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Children's Game","Fantasy"],"designers":["Owen Wokasch"]}}
