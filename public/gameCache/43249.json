In TBGGG players take on two roles:&#10;&#10;Firstly, players represent one of the six game publishers: Eggertspiele, Hans im Gl&uuml;ck, Queen, R&amp;D, Treefrog or Ystari, supplying their company&rsquo;s games to the games shops of Boardway.  Geek Gold (GG) is earned for each game they sell.  Secondly, each player has a team of three &lsquo;dicey&rsquo; geeks who are trying to collect sets of games to meet their gaming group&rsquo;s requirements.  At the end of the game GG is awarded to record the player&rsquo;s success in acquiring these games.  The player accumulating the most GG is the winner.&#10;&#10;TBGGG is a fast paced, tactical, fun game for 3 to 6 players (with &lsquo;geeky English start player&rsquo; option), which takes around 60 to 75 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jdvBm7ht0dGoD73Mh8fabg__original/img/Ky15DyitZSr2-TqCtSVNz7YEvNw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic561490.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jdvBm7ht0dGoD73Mh8fabg__thumb/img/d0v8iuDAlSab9oDjE1g2dRJEcDc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic561490.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/43249","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":[5,6],"averageRating":"5.98085","averageWeight":"2.1","boardGameRank":"8311","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"categories":["Bluffing","Deduction","Economic","Industry / Manufacturing"],"designers":["Richard Breese"]}}
