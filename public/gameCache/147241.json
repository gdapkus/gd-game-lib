    "description": "Among the many reasons that Oaxaca (pronounced wah-HA-kah) is well known are its exquisite handicrafts. Drawing upon generations of tradition, as well as Oaxaca&rsquo;s vast quantities of raw materials, entire families within this state in Southern Mexico dedicate their lives to perfecting their craft. You are a family of skilled Oaxacan handicraftsmen preparing to sell your artisan wares to eager tourists at a bustling tianguis (a large, outdoor market) within Oaxaca City. Can you lead your family to a distinguished position with your exquisite craftsmanship, or are your crafts common for the culture?\n\nGOAL\nSpecialize in specific craft types to create more desirable handicrafts. The player who has the most valuable collection of crafts in their Market Stall at the end of the final round is the winner.\n\n",
