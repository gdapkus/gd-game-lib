A team of two players &ndash; neighbors at the table &ndash; choose a word or phrase that the other players need to guess. Acting together, this team places pieces judiciously on the available icons on the game board.&#10;&#10;To get others to guess &quot;milk&quot;, for example, the team might place the question mark icon (which signifies the main concept) on the liquid icon, then cubes of this color on the icons for &quot;food/drink&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. For a more complicated concept, such as &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio&quot;, the team can use the main concept and its matching cubes to clue players into the hidden phrase being an actor or director, while then using sub-concept icons and their matching cubes to gives clues to particular movies in which DiCaprio starred, such as Titanic or Inception.&#10;&#10;The first player to discover the word or phrase receives 2 victory points, the team receives points as well, and the player who ends up with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHFs0_KRoW_FJ0cMIVgZcw__original/img/vbR7Wrdlq4fPcwUE1Ck9CowlJHY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4991925.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHFs0_KRoW_FJ0cMIVgZcw__thumb/img/1MmGQvJVNw8TA7eWAJ8oIK-ZENc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4991925.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/147151","minPlayers":"4","maxPlayers":"12","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"6.75527","averageWeight":"1.3817","boardGameRank":"1037","mechanics":["Communication Limits","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Party Game","Word Game"],"designers":["GaÃ«tan Beaujannot","Alain Rivollet"]}}
