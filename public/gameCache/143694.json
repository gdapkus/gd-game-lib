This renovation is going to bring high-end jobs, as well as highly skilled workers, and it's going to improve our quality of life in this city.&quot;&#10;       &ndash;Elizabeth Mills&#10;&#10;Second Thoughts is the second Data Pack in the &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner - The Card Game. The time has come for both corps and runners to take a second look at how they want to wage their burgeoning cyberwars. Are the flash and the sparkle of the newest encryption and decryption technologies luring corps and runners away from basic efficiencies? Are basic efficiencies too blunt to counter their opponents' increasingly nuanced strategies?&#10;&#10;The time has come to explore new angles, inventive new uses for programs, and the importance of public perception. It's time for runners to become more creative and less obvious with their program design. It's time for the corps to run a two-pronged assault on the whole runner culture, employing lethal new ice and Black Ops teams, even as they bolster their public images with new PR campaigns. Control the message. Control the game. If you can't shatter your opponent's economy, perhaps you can change the nature of the contest. It's time for Second Thoughts.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ydsBTuorGahIYIbbd4nVNA__original/img/9KhVPBvCCngXFetVpZ2xXgFKCVk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1704797.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ydsBTuorGahIYIbbd4nVNA__thumb/img/Wi-VipFcC-eFbDwPReTB3021GMM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1704797.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/143694","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null,"averageRating":"8.06619","averageWeight":"3.1739","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Points","Hand Management","Secret Unit Deployment","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Bluffing","Card Game","Collectible Components","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Richard Garfield","Lukas Litzsinger","Damon Stone"]}}
