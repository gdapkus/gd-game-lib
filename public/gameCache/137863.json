Runners have used their new ice [sic] and upgraded hardware to launch series after series of runs, and Corps have respond by channeling funds into the development of new ice and server upgrades. In a world where the next, stronger piece of ice or game-changing icebreaker is just several lines of code away, what truly is Future Proof?&#10;&#10;Future Proof concludes the &quot;Genesis Cycle&quot; with sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that balance the latest upgrades in software with a renewed focus on resources in the meat world. In addition to their innovative new icebreakers, the game&rsquo;s Runners get new resources and events while the Corporations focus on bolstering their servers and developing assets designed for open hostilities. When tricks, traps, and roadblocks don&rsquo;t serve as sufficient deterrents, some Corporations will meet the Runners with swords in hand, ready for virtual duels.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ar0BKAW5ezdK85iQKFmzsw__original/img/I92C0PREKRc4gm8gsGgOaCvHQwI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1639611.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ar0BKAW5ezdK85iQKFmzsw__thumb/img/IQCKQaYaejnyvxneEM_HL7T1LtY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1639611.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/137863","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
