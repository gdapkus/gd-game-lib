It adds several new river sections with three new terrain features: sand bars, floating logs, and coal refueling stations.  The first two are new hazards which slow paddle-boats down which enter (or are pushed into) those hexes.  The last one is a location at which paddle-boats can dock to refill their coal.&#10;&#10;Also adds a sixth paddle-boat (so that six people can now play), a second red paddle-boat (used in two-player games) and the &quot;Black Rose&quot;: a black paddle-wheeler that is controlled by whichever player is currently in last place.  This boat does not require any coal and can be used to hamper opponents in the lead.&#10;&#10;Contains new rules and variants, including rules for two players.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Mississippi Queen&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TJG7lfByWeOtPdEXE--Q_A__original/img/ySCFVRQxnBnQ-zDGhsSI7E6IB_Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic157475.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TJG7lfByWeOtPdEXE--Q_A__thumb/img/QXYoGOdbHtbBCxwzqw86wFh-6zw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic157475.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1565","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1998","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
