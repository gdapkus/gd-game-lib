Gather friends and family together to enjoy the favorite word-guessing game in real life with Wordle: The Party Game! Inspired by the digital version of the Wordle game, this analog game for 2-4 players delivers the classic Wordle gameplay as an exciting party game. Each round, a player designated as the Wordle Host writes down a Secret Word. Just like the original Wordle game, players try to guess it in the few-est tries (six max). But in this game, players are competing against others. The fewer tries a player needs, the fewer points they score. The player with the fewest points at the end of the game wins! Try the classic play or 3 variations! In fast mode, players race to solve the Wordle first. In timed mode, beat the clock&mdash;or receive more points. Or compete in groups with team mode. A great game for game night with friends and family.&#10;&#10;Includes 3 Wordle boards, 3 shields, 1 Secret Word board, 3 dry-erase markers, 45 green tiles, 45 yellow tiles, and game guide.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kJRoj974u0WonSVVyybYFA__original/img/urnv6vhY8l9Hs1OTBTYmhjx2nDM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6979221.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kJRoj974u0WonSVVyybYFA__thumb/img/-RQDi3nVyiLdw4uII7Lttrv4A_4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6979221.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/367033","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2022","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"0","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":[4],"averageRating":"5.19823","averageWeight":"1.2","boardGameRank":"25984","mechanics":["Deduction","Real-Time","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Deduction","Real-time","Word Game"],"designers":["Joe Bradford","Sophie Horton-Jones"]}}
