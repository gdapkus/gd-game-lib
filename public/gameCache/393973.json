Touted by the media as the most important sporting event of the Cold War, an incomparable thriller unfolded...and now, you can be right in the middle of it.&#10;&#10;In Match of the Century, you play one another over a series of games, just as in a real championship match. However, here each game lasts only a few short and intense turns, so every decision counts in pulling off the win. As you play cards with unique effects from your asymmetrical decks, each of you manipulates the mental endurance of the other and the outcome of each quick game, but weigh your options carefully because only by giving up the advantage can you use your cards' effects.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IU6SBjsLhA8-F3zDlkRxTw__original/img/yorOEmhS9guYNxgCaKk9TUClDPc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7618302.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IU6SBjsLhA8-F3zDlkRxTw__thumb/img/e5tbTUFpGBUlxATgdeVD0aXrabA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7618302.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/393973","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2023","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.61048","averageWeight":"2.6296","boardGameRank":"2758","mechanics":["Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management","Multi-Use Cards","Race","Tug of War","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Card Game"],"designers":["Paolo Mori"]}}
