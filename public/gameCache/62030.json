After 5 years the settlers were forced to leave the city, exhausted by the difficulties and by the continuous attacks of the indigenous Querandies. The city was destroyed by the natives some weeks after.&#10;&#10;Almost fifty years later Juan de Garay leads a new expedition and founds a new city. As before, resources are low and the natives are angry! &#10;But not only that: now the Corsairs paid by the English Crown threaten the new Spanish settlement!&#10;&#10;Rio de la Plata is a strategy game where players represent the chiefs of the families of Spanish settlers of Buenos Aires.
