These ambassadors are willing to offer their services and strengthen the bonds of the newly-formed alliance.&#10;&#10;These ambassadors are introduced in the game with the addition of a fourth action that allows the players to invite them to their station and make them part of their Council. Each ambassador comes with a different ability, based on his race's strengths and capabilities. However, there is limited space in each player's Council so they have to choose wisely who they are going to invite.&#10;&#10;Among the Stars: The Ambassadors is a boxed expansion for Among the Stars featuring more than 150 new cards. Apart from the Ambassador cards, it includes more than twenty different new Locations, new Objectives, a new Alien race, new Conflict sets (to replace the original one, rather than mix with).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fl5dD7WGqBl-9PB0znQNfQ__original/img/iNPTSfyEq7VrnbIE6NjZKoI_t5k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1801598.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fl5dD7WGqBl-9PB0znQNfQ__thumb/img/bNdYkKTLRuELi1FFZY0X-v-XnZ8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1801598.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/139630","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2013","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"3"}}
