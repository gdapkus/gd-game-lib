Each turn, players get 7 chits with +/- values on them, 5 of which they may use to secretly vote for the bands they want to support. Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total. Very nice artwork and goofy band names (as only the Germans can do it) are complemented by one of the cooler game components ever; a wooden &quot;CD Player&quot; that the DJ (dealer) uses to tally up the votes.&#10;&#10;Please be aware that, although this was formerly listed as a family game, a few of the band names contain adult language.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     BrettspielWelt (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ur5Q2P5l-uPPu16j5NmnIA__original/img/JFbBouqsvIURiCCgpAJ0vNJMWnE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic318386.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ur5Q2P5l-uPPu16j5NmnIA__thumb/img/eRjf6jRJZepfo3QFJADJEYFLSEI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic318386.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/831","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1999","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"90","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":"6"}}
