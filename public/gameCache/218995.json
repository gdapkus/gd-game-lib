Each round, they choose one or two (depending on the number of players), reveal them at the same time, then execute the actions in a fixed order. This allows the players to collect goods, exchange them for victory points, or even receive victory points directly. However, with a limited supply of goods and points in each round, the strength of a card depends on which cards the others have played.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9YH1P8E0dScDsUbfj5u4vg__original/img/rkgw5bS2OhqEN-R-w83bdD3QgKk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4990951.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9YH1P8E0dScDsUbfj5u4vg__thumb/img/jdLyhadKgokw3vdbgTxyh221CD0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4990951.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/218995","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":"4"}}
