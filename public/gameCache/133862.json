    "description": "Heroes versus monsters in a fight-to-the-death on the streets of New York!\n\nIn Moongha Invaders Two Player, one player plays the monsters, and the other the heroes. As they move around the city collecting weapons and generally wreaking havoc and destruction. The heroes must kill the three main monsters, and the monsters must eliminate all of the heroes. Whoever does that first, wins!\n\nIt is a two-player version of Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth!. It was available as a stretch goal during the main game's Kickstarter campaign and is also available as a print-and-play version.\n\nMoongha Invaders Two Player requires a copy of the main game, as it re-uses components from it.\n\n",
