It arrives to X-Wing as a well-rounded, small-base, Scum and Villainy starship with three attack, two agility, four hull, and one shield. You gain one of these miniature starfighters in the Kihraxz Fighter Expansion Pack, carefully pre-painted and sculpted at the game&rsquo;s standard 1/270 scale. Additionally, the Kihraxz Fighter Expansion Pack comes with four ship cards, five upgrades, a maneuver dial, and all the tokens you need to fly this fighter into any battle in which the galaxy&rsquo;s Scum have a vested interest.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TqmYII8q8u5CpM4gPaYvaQ__original/img/s6onuCANFiG1rZaGs88aq5Q7nIM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2786264.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TqmYII8q8u5CpM4gPaYvaQ__thumb/img/WIaYt6m7cHW29PMSUJ0wVH_0dFo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2786264.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/176820","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"0","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
