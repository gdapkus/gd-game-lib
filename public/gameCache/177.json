Playing with this expansion is no more difficult than playing the base Civilization game.  This expansion reworks a few of the original rules, includes a reworked version of Civilization: Expansion Trade Cards Set and adds more civilization advancements to the technology tree.&#10;&#10;Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which remove the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogeneous while others claim the reverse is true.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ROB7NpxefRUmpR9UroQ8w__original/img/--qlhvNNj8zF9cWLlihdTg0jzmE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic87459.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ROB7NpxefRUmpR9UroQ8w__thumb/img/XDH667tVl2KjQ6szNjT7ceEmh5E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic87459.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/177","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1991","playingTime":"480","minPlayingTime":"360","maxPlayingTime":"480","bestAtCount":[6,8],"averageRating":"8.01081","averageWeight":"3.6651","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Area Movement","Commodity Speculation","Set Collection","Trading"],"categories":["Ancient","Civilization","Economic","Expansion for Base-game","Negotiation"],"designers":["Lauren Banerd","Jim Eliason","Jeff Groteboer","Bruce Harper","Eric Hunter","Steven Padgett","Gary Rapanos","Michael Roos","Jennifer Schlickbernd","Jeff Suchard"]}}
