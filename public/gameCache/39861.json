Included are more than 50 new scenarios and advanced campaign rules covering three Theaters of Operations throughout the War: The Battle for Normandy in the summer of 1944, the Blitzkrieg to the West in 1940, and Operation Barbarossa on the Russian Front in 1941.&#10;&#10;The new campaign rules let you play scenarios in succession, with the outcome of each battle impacting what follows: each success brings you closer to victory, while defeats will deal you temporary set-backs, or worse, the complete rout of your Army!&#10;&#10;With the Memoir '44 Campaign book, you'll step into the boots of Montgomery, or head out at the front of a German column to try and throw the Allies back to the sea. Unleash your Panzers onto hapless Belgium and France, or advance into the frozen steppes of the Soviet empire.&#10;&#10;Part of the Memoir &#039;44 series.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Normandy can be played without any expansions, but you will need tiles from Memoir '44: Terrain Pack and Memoir '44: Eastern Front for Blitzkrieg to the West and Operation Barbarossa.&#10;&#10;One of the twelve campaigns also requires Memoir '44: Air Pack, which is recommended, though not required, for the other campaigns.&#10;&#10;Buy the Microbadge&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d66k0VCV5jgAqRNaxR9I7A__original/img/Kun1-5K0cKpsNuX5ZeAqLJY_BCE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic410572.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d66k0VCV5jgAqRNaxR9I7A__thumb/img/06jOpGs9nUWLCwt79ECdKqzkFzE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic410572.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/39861","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"40","minPlayingTime":"40","maxPlayingTime":"40","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"8.20653","averageWeight":"2.4068","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Modular Board"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Wargame","World War II"],"designers":["Richard Borg","Don Clarke","Jacques David","Malcolm Green"]}}
