Most ships are fighter and heavy-fighters in size, but there are expansions to include gunboats and small capital ships. Each ship has a control sheet to make all bookkeeping (mostly damage and ammo when necessary) easier. The game is normally played in 10 turns, each player alternate moving all ships before making attacks.&#10;&#10;From designer's notes:&#10;Silent Death is an attempt to produce a fun and fast-moving game that is simple to learn. The mix of design trade-offs (detail for playability) in the Standard Game feels about right, but since you can't satisfy all of the people all of the time, we piled in a bunch of optional rules so players can find their own optimum mix; either simpler or more complex.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Silent Death: The Next Millennium Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HUhufXvh_eyIR6Drnggcxw__original/img/DK9CvXGvdAg8nTdjkVt_c3Ty3w0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6338727.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HUhufXvh_eyIR6Drnggcxw__thumb/img/f1wzxnf0LfmOJIC2ws2c1Qx52Sc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6338727.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/3895","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1990","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":[2,4],"averageRating":"6.99352","averageWeight":"2.7627","boardGameRank":"5452","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Simulation","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Miniatures","Science Fiction","Wargame"],"designers":["Kevin Barrett"]}}
