In addition to your normal tile placement and optional follower placement, you may place one of your tunnel chips on any exposed tunnel entrance (whether on a tile from Der Tunnel or from another expansion) on the table, regardless of whether that entrance is on the tile you just played. Once both of your tunnel chips have been placed, they connect the two roads, wherever they might be. Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gPxt3w08U167abSKLP8VjQ__original/img/4d6Rvx9NKpzLxQEIzhuRGSoA5AU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic595711.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gPxt3w08U167abSKLP8VjQ__thumb/img/Qi2sQM09oYGNQzky8rRV4Rh1HNg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic595711.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/59065","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"2"}}
