Quomodo dominabis proelia quae in agro, in senatu, et per vias Romae accident?&#10;&#10;On the banks of the Rubicon a legionnaire&rsquo;s footstep brings Civil War and sets upon a course of events from which an emperor will emerge. How will you master the battles that are to come on the field, in the senate and through the streets of Rome?&#10;&#10;Triumvirate is a fast-paced game for two that requires subtle hand management and card play to win consistently.  The mechanisms in the core rules make for a very satisfying, imperfect information player trick taking game. In addition to the core game there is a drafting variant that removes randomness from play beyond the initial card deal.&#10;&#10;The game is currently available in Classical Latin, English, German, French, Catalan, Polish, Spanish and Dutch.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uu2PjSlpZpefCemLo-5Ywg__original/img/zO3eLNhPSdWLOaZM_DGJ6uasCV8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic750750.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uu2PjSlpZpefCemLo-5Ywg__thumb/img/-Q9nVmRZdpCd_YkG5fB30N7nW-Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic750750.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/53168","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.66752","averageWeight":"1.9265","boardGameRank":"4238","mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Open Drafting","Trick-taking"],"categories":["Ancient","Bluffing","Card Game","Deduction"],"designers":["Travis Worthington"]}}
