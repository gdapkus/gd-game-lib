At the start of play, draw a random medal and place it face up between each pairing of players. (Each pairing already has a card rack between it, so now two items will be present.) When either of these players meets the conditions showing on a medal, they claim the medal and turn it face down, earning 4vp for this medal at game's end.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2_Txc05pBFijBPqoCUsHxA__original/img/BDZ4vwFSg3Z22bShxT9X4do7Q8U=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7796076.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2_Txc05pBFijBPqoCUsHxA__thumb/img/Lf9BeWSkmM1EiVTu1BkTmWFoinY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7796076.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/403217","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","yearPublished":"2024","playingTime":"25","minPlayingTime":"25","maxPlayingTime":"25","bestAtCount":[4,6],"averageRating":"7.82912","averageWeight":"1.4286","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Ancient","Expansion for Base-game"],"designers":["Antoine Bauza"]}}
