Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn.  Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.  Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of what is referred to as the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vLDgCpcL-beOsC5iWfZ9ig__original/img/upBZeKEaQHY6LZS7R-hykx6a7kY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3515154.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vLDgCpcL-beOsC5iWfZ9ig__thumb/img/TPQCIaZKOl2ApBfBk0HgVjVsovw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3515154.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/88","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1999","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
