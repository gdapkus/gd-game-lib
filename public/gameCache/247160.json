One lump or two?&quot;&#10;&#10;It's the most sought-after invitation of the year: Dinoton Abbey for high tea. Now you're all gussied up in your finery and ready for some tea and chit-chat. One problem: You can't remember anyone's name. Who's that, sporting the fancy brooch with her pet chicken? Is that Jeannine? Beatriz? Oh, dear. If you're not careful, you'll commit a faux pas everyone will be gossiping about.&#10;&#10;Dinosaur Tea Party is a game of pure deduction for 3-5 homo sapiens. Each player takes a card corresponding to one of the dino guests. Players take turns asking each other questions or guessing their dinosaur's name. If someone guesses your name, draw a new card. The first player to guess three names wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1i5n8m3cczz7WDQKVGWXw__original/img/8-4AK_2fJ3x-UJmwuccPuw_hhGE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4000020.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1i5n8m3cczz7WDQKVGWXw__thumb/img/L6R1wQ2TywGUJoqVe0tEx1TTSjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4000020.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/247160","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2018","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"15","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[4,5],"averageRating":"6.42669","averageWeight":"1.2083","boardGameRank":"3787","mechanics":["Memory","Pattern Recognition"],"categories":["Animals","Card Game","Deduction","Humor","Memory","Party Game","Prehistoric"],"designers":["Rob Daviau","JR Honeycutt","Justin D.
