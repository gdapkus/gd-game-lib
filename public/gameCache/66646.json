They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.&#10;&#10;Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.&#10;&#10;Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L4k50H_P0oLJaqvTrb8ENA__original/img/37ueUxgMHf-sF4v3CXtWEWZ4p7c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4134883.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L4k50H_P0oLJaqvTrb8ENA__thumb/img/xlzGcVmSjeUndxbcUS1s06k2kgM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4134883.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/66646","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2010","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"3"}}
