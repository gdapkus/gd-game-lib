There, he stares at the drive in his hand before booting up his console. Was he able to complete his download? Does this drive truly contain the net&rsquo;s legendary source protocols? What will he find? After a series of thrilling encounters with Corporate security measures and security officers, all he has to do is pull up the files.&#10;&#10;At the end of your lunar expedition, the sixty new cards in The Source (three copies each of twenty different cards) reveal surprising new takes on life, evolution, and death in the virtual world and the cyberstruggles of Android: Netrunner. You&rsquo;ll find assets that reward Corps for birthing new servers and others that can self-destruct. You&rsquo;ll find self-propagating viruses waiting to explode into the network, and you&rsquo;ll find programs that reward you for jacking out of your runs.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-x4cvKxJGpyhR5IfiC0BA__original/img/qQRqWFLISVD5UCfjIzeJ2EAa640=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3166962.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-x4cvKxJGpyhR5IfiC0BA__thumb/img/Q3MecQylZrvC0HBCvUsU90vJR1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3166962.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/162359","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2014","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":null}}
