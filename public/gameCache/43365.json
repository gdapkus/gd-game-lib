In this game, players are purchasing auctioned shares to run or share in the profits of one of six railroads that begin on the Eastern edge of Kansas. The railroads gain income by passing through a variety of Kansas cities and towns, with sizable income available for those that go through Wichita or Topeka.  There is an additional mechanism and incentive for furthering the railroads westward: the Western quarter of the state is a 'land grant' area where the railroads can gain additional track cubes, and rail lines that reach the Colorado border receive a sizable income bonus.  When the game ends, the player with the most cash on hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uC67Cn0P3XjTp2JH9WuxA__original/img/pjWfWmNXPIX9hnOiSyFFZf03u0E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2404057.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uC67Cn0P3XjTp2JH9WuxA__thumb/img/x_gXp_msz7moE4-y_uo7jGDNgsY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2404057.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/43365","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2009","playingTime":"100","minPlayingTime":"100","maxPlayingTime":"100","bestAtCount":"4"}}
