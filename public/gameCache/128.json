Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4uhHaI4jH-S9SqQ3s9dIrw__original/img/E9x2aqIuUK-msNMWo5UA8Ae_xLo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3108440.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4uhHaI4jH-S9SqQ3s9dIrw__thumb/img/meHHpFd-n5Z9fA8HB_Pp76eRmaE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3108440.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/128","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1983","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"2"}}
