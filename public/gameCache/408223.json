Australia's huge deposits of uranium were ripe for the taking, leading to visionaries &mdash; lured by the vast number of possibilities &mdash; visiting the continent and changing it into a new global power. Here, these entrepreneurs have to face new challenges presented by the sheer size of the continent. Fortunately, the clever use of shipping lanes will help them transport resources more efficiently than by rail and even gain access to the nearby island of Tasmania, where a mad scientist conducting his own experiments managed to replicate Elsa's invention, which is now proudly presented as an experimental power plant in the island's capital of Hobart.&#10;&#10;Nucleum: Australia comes with a new map that introduces several new concepts and rule changes to the Nucleum base game. Use shipping lanes to expand your networks, build your own coal mines, and try the expert variant with bidding for the experiments.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0RwM7yB6zmKoqSxs1Puhw__original/img/9po8MavVqlOE8JwRRZiG37odyuE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7898418.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0RwM7yB6zmKoqSxs1Puhw__thumb/img/sMrqoBm1qnLkk8mr5CncznITD9c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7898418.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/408223","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2024","playingTime":"150","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"150","bestAtCount":[3,4],"averageRating":"8.481","averageWeight":"4.3333","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Income","Market","Network and Route Building","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Economic","Industry / Manufacturing","Science Fiction"],"designers":["Simone Luciani","DÃ¡vid Turczi"]}}
