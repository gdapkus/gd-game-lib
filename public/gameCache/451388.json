    "description": "The galaxy stands on the edge of a blade. A great struggle is coming, and only the greatest among them all will triumph.\n\nWelcome to Thunder&rsquo;s Edge, a new expansion for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition! This colossal expansion brings the classic interstellar conflict to a breaking point, where everything revolves around the titular planet of Thunder&rsquo;s Edge. New factions take to the galactic stage, new worlds emerge for you to explore (or exploit), and a suite of Galactic Events&mdash;modifiers that change the rules of the game&mdash;ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be the same.\n\nAlso included is the brand-new Twilight&rsquo;s Fall mode, an alternate way to play Twilight Imperium. Take up the mantle of a mad Mahact king, build your own custom faction from the scraps of interstellar civilization, and battle to become the supreme ruler of the galaxy. This mode comes with its own spread of unique components, making it almost an entirely new game!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
