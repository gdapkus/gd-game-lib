    "description": "You and your fellow players work in a coffee shop in Order Overload: Cafe, and to keep your jobs, you need to keep a handle on all the orders coming in. Will you be able to make the right drinks?\n\nIn a round, you deal a certain number of cards face up and read them aloud so that everyone knows all the orders placed, then you deal these cards out face down to the players. On a turn, you need to name an order that's in someone else's hand. Fail to do so, and you're eliminated from play! If you collectively reveal a set number of drinks before everyone is eliminated, then you clear the level and are ready to take on tougher challenges...\n\nWhat's the highest level you can clear?\n\n",
