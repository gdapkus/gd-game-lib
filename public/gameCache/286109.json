The royalty reign supreme, but alongside of their control are the plotting citizens, planning to get ahead using any means possible.&#10;&#10;Hierarchy is an abstract game of order and power where players each take a random set of 7 cards and play them openly, until they cannot play any more. Cards must be played atop a card of a lesser value, unless either the last card - or the currently played card change those rules. When the active player can no longer play a card, their opponent has won the game and has taken the seat of power away from their opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the January 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMnhqrNWKXe_0bkII-V7Hw__original/img/jdMzcQ-KDhuBsuYxwPvY2lOsQms=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4943154.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMnhqrNWKXe_0bkII-V7Hw__thumb/img/rF0Jh0NCz5_48ld89fiaO6_g3qs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4943154.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/286109","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2020","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.71435","averageWeight":"1.3333","boardGameRank":"6492","mechanics":["Hand Management"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Card Game","Print & Play"],"designers":["Hugo Kawamata"]}}
