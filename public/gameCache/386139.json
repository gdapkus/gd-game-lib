If it fits, anything goes.\n\nEach round in NUCK TATS, one player reveals a customer &mdash; a celebrity, character, mythical creature, whoever &mdash; and everyone else writes nuck tats for that customer. The best tat wins the round...and if your friends make you laugh, feel free to throw them a tip. It's that easy!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
