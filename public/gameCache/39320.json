    "description": "In Potions, everyone is a \"wizarding\" apprentice competing to become a wizard. The first apprentice to collect five Potion Class Credit Tokens wins. Players collect Potion Class Credit Tokens by being the first to obtain a set of cards that match the potion recipe as instructed by a roll of the potion dice. Watch out for other aspiring wizards &ndash; they will try to change the recipe, steal your ingredients, and spill your cauldron.\n\n",
