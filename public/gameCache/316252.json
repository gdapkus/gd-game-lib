    "description": "Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance is a 6-card expansion for Skulls of Sedlec, allowing for solo play.\n\n\nThe Bone Monstrance is one of the ornate sculptures that decorate the inside of the Sedlec Ossuary. As a monk, you will toil away at exhuming graves and arranging skulls into stacks. As an artist though, you will need to be very creative to sculpt a truly original piece that will please the royal family!\n\nThis solo expansion celebrates these works of art by allowing you to create six unique features alongside a standard, pyramid-shaped stack of skulls. Each play session adds a condition that will make this undertaking a challenge for even the sharpest skull-stacker!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
