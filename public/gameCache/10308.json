Fought between 1756 and 1762, the Seven Years War was one of parry and thrust, rather than frontal assault.  In a period of shifting alliances and evolving military techniques, leadership was the key factor.&#10;&#10;The Campaigns of Frederick the Great uses innovative command and combat systems, and an interactive game system, to mirror the subtleties of 18th Century Warfare.  Features include troop commitment, cavalry pursuit, sieges, forced marches, and more.  No game will ever be won by sheer numbers - only by skill.&#10;&#10;(from back of Game box)&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;34&quot; x 22&quot; map, 400 counters, 12 page rulebook, 12 pages of charts and tables.&#10;&#10;The map is very similar to SPI's/AH's Frederick the Great: The Campaigns of The Soldier King 1756-1759 game, but with roads added.  Seven yearly scenarios plus campaign.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zSXCNxjoqgKz4jG-j421Cw__original/img/R8_S-pF1mSCA5PznAgmcoL-xiYA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic43025.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zSXCNxjoqgKz4jG-j421Cw__thumb/img/Z8I5b8Bi7kALYL_6eOLHKBUpBcM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic43025.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/10308","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"1993","playingTime":"180","minPlayingTime":"180","maxPlayingTime":"180","bestAtCount":[2,4],"averageRating":"6.24648","averageWeight":"2.5","boardGameRank":"16776","mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid"],"categories":["Age of Reason","Wargame"],"designers":["Robert G.
