Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders).  Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;The game rules include the following scenarios:&#10;First Bull Run--21st July, 1861&#10;Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862&#10;Kernstown--23rd March, 1862&#10;Shiloh--6th April, 1862&#10;Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862&#10;Brawner's Farm--28th August, 1862&#10;Antietam--17th September, 1862&#10;Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862&#10;Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862&#10;Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863&#10;Chickamauga--20th September, 1863&#10;New Market--15th May, 1864&#10;New Hope Church--25th May, 1864&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQtwxlqZJveWv0Sm9SZVSg__original/img/a_S_P0dbH5q51nJTsrMb4ENNoak=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6531255.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQtwxlqZJveWv0Sm9SZVSg__thumb/img/CkPgv8E1sK6fdzJEn_0T2xET6Hw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6531255.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/551","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"1999","playingTime":"45","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"45","bestAtCount":"2"}}
