Her Force leaps allow her to move quickly into position wherever she&rsquo;s needed most, and then she can press the attack with one blue die and two green dice, as well as the ability to reroll all her attack dice or all the defender's defense dice.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll find more of Ahsoka's talents, spirit, and connection to the Force represented among the expansion&rsquo;s mission and Command cards. Four of these Command cards strengthen her connection to the Force, and the fifth takes full advantage of her talents as a Spy. Finally, two new skirmish missions provide ample opportunities for you to fight alongside Ahsoka, sowing chaos in the heart of the Empire.&#10;&#10;This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Heart of the Empire expansion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a4DKF5V-xlWtX88AnM90ig__original/img/43yYO3g3FOxCN-XPjR5C3E-5cBU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3564212.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a4DKF5V-xlWtX88AnM90ig__thumb/img/eQrqnvaBQrHXAbmdRAwGBh_ZA6k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3564212.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/226836","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":null}}
