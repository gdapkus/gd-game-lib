Every turn you may increase the indicated amount of money on the card and use it to buy buildings.&#10;&#10;-Die K&uuml;nste der Mauren (the art of the Moorish). Tiles.&#10;With these tiles you can get extra points for the amount of buildings you have of the same value.&#10;&#10;-Die Macht des Sultans (the power of the sultan). Cards and a die.&#10;You can buy the card for 7 of the indicated color. Then you roll the die and mark the building on the card. When a new building of that color is added to the building site, you can take it, even if it is not your turn.&#10;&#10;-Die neuen Wertungsk&auml;rtchen (the new valuation cards). Tiles.&#10;At the beginning of the game you draw 3 tiles that show different ranking orders for the buildings for the three valuations.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zHSerJ8o1RCefrmtXC1T8g__original/img/cPZtfKt_uJlfcHiDjly1Em3ZJ_Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic605383.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zHSerJ8o1RCefrmtXC1T8g__thumb/img/_LncpIGJAMdqeXIlVvRN6h45sNU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic605383.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/39109","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"3"}}
