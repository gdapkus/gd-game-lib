The Drive on Moscow, 1941","type":"boardgame","description":"In the fall of 1941, the German Blitzkrieg was ready for one more final grand effort: the conquest of Moscow. Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 900,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.&#10;&#10;The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.&#10;&#10;The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.&#10;Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign. See if you have the skill to crush or save the Soviet Empire in 1941.&#10; ---COUNTERS-----------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;4 1/2 Countersheets totaling 1080 full-color two-sided counters&#10;&#10;-Countersheets 1,2,3,5 are full sheets of 240 counters each&#10;-Countersheet 4 is a half sheet of 120 counters&#10;&#10;---MAPS---------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;-3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;&#10;---OTHER--------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;-1 D10&#10;-1 24-page Rule-book&#10;-1 24-page Play-book&#10;-1 Typhoon!
