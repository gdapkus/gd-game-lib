The player may secretly change one of their cards for one of the cards received. The player then returns a card to the Court deck and a card to their Target.&#10;&#10;The Target may also claim the Jester role to avoid giving (and thus receiving) a role card.&#10;&#10;The Target of the Captain may claim the Jester in order to block Stealing.&#10;&#10;This promo was available as part of the KickStarter edition of Coup: Rebellion G54.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R2yI2CQnt-Cy1mj2obQRzA__original/img/jIyJVV6-QzOw67uXO9F0ppW_FXg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2715503.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R2yI2CQnt-Cy1mj2obQRzA__thumb/img/k3uD39hoJ2W6Wqjg54zLyl6Lf6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2715503.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/186524","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"10","yearPublished":"2015","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"10","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":"5"}}
