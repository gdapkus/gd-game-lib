    "description": "Design-wise, think of 1828 as 1830 with 16 companies, 7 ranks of trains, 4 rusting events, money- and asset-losing mergers & an even more perilous stock market in 3-5 hours.  So, really not much like 1830 at all other than surface appearances.\n\nDesigned on request by a friend for a game that would help teach second-order concepts in the 18xx.\n\n&mdash;description from the designer\n\n",
