He may rule with an iron grip, but his most prized artifacts are about to slip through his cyborg claws.

Space! is built on the same game system as Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure, with players building a personal deck of cards throughout the course of the game, with the cards allowing them to move through the spaceship, attack things, acquire new cards, and &mdash; oh yeah &mdash; make noise to attract Lord Eradikus and potentially seal their own doom.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/haDQw7X8Z0VOItfow9eDtg__original/img/Gq7eW_IFnUgIFcWcZSbWihAzdTs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3720843.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/haDQw7X8Z0VOItfow9eDtg__thumb/img/mn9ypbuCR2pwOSvor46QRXgVImM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3720843.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/233371","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2017","playingTime":"90","minPlayingTime":"45","maxPlayingTime":"90","bestAtCount":[3],"averageRating":"7.7791","averageWeight":"2.5741","boardGameRank":"139","mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Delayed Purchase","Modular Board","Open Drafting","Player Elimination","Point to Point Movement","Push Your Luck"],"categories":["Science Fiction"],"designers":["Paul Dennen"]}}
