What initially was thought of as strange, unknown devices clinging to the walls or closed in mysterious crates in the hold, all disappeared in a moment. At the same time you could hear shrill, metallic squeaks in the dark corridors. Someone saw beady, lifeless eyes in the tech bay. When steel blades emerged from the darkness to the accompaniment of a mechanical, grinding sound, it was too late for the rescue...&#10;&#10;Theseus: The Dark Orbit &ndash; Bots introduces the Bots faction to the game Theseus: The Dark Orbit. Bots can be used instead of any other faction from the base game.
