    "description": "Days of Future Past is a Kickstarter Exclusive expansion that brings by far the largest foes your Heroes have ever faced, the giant Sentinels! Join Logan in a timeline when mutants are being systematically hunted down by these mechanical terrors. Like clockwork, these titanic robots follow an activation protocol that adapts to the Heroes&rsquo; every move. You will have to band together and bring them down as quickly as possible, before the powerful Nimrod is fully activated, if you are to have any chance of defeating him.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
