Players or teams move their pawn around the board trying to gain two wisdom cards for each of the four territories.  Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.  The board also contains areas to help the players move around the board and/or interfere with the progress of their opponents.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZQLv21XBucB7vs-XE1KmWQ__original/img/0YcM3Lkox85SZbFwYyHphnOpksg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3816.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZQLv21XBucB7vs-XE1KmWQ__thumb/img/y581TB-3IJoDvdOlbp_ZqtKeGCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3816.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/1636","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"8","yearPublished":"1986","playingTime":"120","minPlayingTime":"120","maxPlayingTime":"120","bestAtCount":"4"}}
