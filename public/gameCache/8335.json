This card game is meant to be played while talking at parties, roleplaying, riding in the car or even watching TV. Each of the 100 cards contains a word or action and a point value. When someone else says or does what is listed, they get the card. Whoever has the least amount of points in the end wins. It's that simple! Each two-piece box comes with 100 custom illustrated cards and complete rules for three different ways to play including a word rummy variation.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nw54KJp-biOua3ghUytUKw__original/img/rHxd2JDGQ_8pYp_Aas5gfUkQitU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic34634.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nw54KJp-biOua3ghUytUKw__thumb/img/jVqnZ6B-RZ0OBx6PTTOkf0CjOGw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic34634.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/8335","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"20","yearPublished":"2003","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":null}}
