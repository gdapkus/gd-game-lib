    "description": "Rebellion Without Rehearsal is the second half of the Liberation Cycle. It concludes the story began in The Automata Initiative, in which the passage of a law set to strip bioroids of personhood caused uproar throughout Brazil. As the protests turn violent, and only the President&rsquo;s signature is needed for this law to be enacted, the activists striving to protect bioroid rights make unlikely alliances and decide how far they&rsquo;re willing to go.\n\nRebellion Without Rehearsal contains full playsets of 65 new Netrunner cards, including three identities.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",
