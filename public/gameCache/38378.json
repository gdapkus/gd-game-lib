As is often the case with expansions, The Big Expansion includes a number of mix-and-match components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces and rules for five-player games.&#10;     An updated version of Rough Road Ahead, a set of cards previously released in a downloadable format on the Czech Games website that will be expanded and reformatted.&#10;     Additional adventure cards, including two previously available only at Spiel 07.&#10;     A special deck of adventure cards that players individually insert into the deck themselves to surprise their fellow drivers.&#10;     A new alien species.&#10;     New ship building components, including life support for the new ET.&#10;     New ship classes.&#10;&#10;&#10;The expansion is not fully compatible with the first edition of Galaxy Trucker, due to component differences. A compatibility kit has been produced, containing replacement components for the base game, but as of March 2009 it is not yet widely available.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJcmLVnXqBYesqjdq1oYpg__original/img/Ld33tkSsEMfdaFThjGwS8Sd6VIs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic384363.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJcmLVnXqBYesqjdq1oYpg__thumb/img/S8GJ0Bl_J0lU8L11s9xkGkJdANw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic384363.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/38378","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","yearPublished":"2008","playingTime":"60","minPlayingTime":"60","maxPlayingTime":"60","bestAtCount":"4"}}
