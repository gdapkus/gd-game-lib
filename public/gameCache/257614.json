Inspired by the ideals of elegance and discretion, these bouquets were carefully made to convey subtle messages to their recipients. Now you can choose the right flowers to make a winning tussie mussie of your own!&#10;&#10;Tussie-Mussie is based on a Victorian fad that assigned meanings to the flowers that friends and lovers exchanged.&#10;&#10;Featuring I-Divide-You-Choose drafting, this microgame of 18 cards is played over three rounds. In turn, players look at the top two cards of the deck, then offer them, one face-up and one facedown, to an opponent.  That opponent takes one, leaving the other for the active player.&#10;&#10;A round ends when each player has four cards, at which point the scores are tallied. The highest score after three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Co-winner of the GenCan't Design Contest.&#10;Released in the September 2019 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bOTxzLrmwptfbAre3JnS3w__original/img/jLs695KU9eJ9iZHiILRMty52Upk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5456717.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bOTxzLrmwptfbAre3JnS3w__thumb/img/IrDl-OdPhX04kz6oNGcl-FzRivw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5456717.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/257614","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","yearPublished":"2019","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"6.9297","averageWeight":"1.1387","boardGameRank":"1312","mechanics":["I Cut, You Choose","Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"categories":["Card Game","Print & Play"],"designers":["Elizabeth Hargrave"]}}
