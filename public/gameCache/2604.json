    "description": "Play is in teams of two. Each person has a deck of picture cards. Each deck has the same set of pictures. There is also a deck of word cards with words like &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;de facto&quot;, and &quot;pimple&quot;.&#10;&#10;A word is chosen and each player chooses 2-5 cards from his/her deck. Teams score points for choosing the same pictures, and score extra points for putting the pictures in the same order (from most to least important).&#10;&#10;The board is used to keep track of the score, and to dictate how many pictures a team may select. First team to the end wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Compatibility 15th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",
