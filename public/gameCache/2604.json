Each deck has the same set of pictures. There is also a deck of word cards with words like &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;de facto&quot;, and &quot;pimple&quot;.&#10;&#10;A word is chosen and each player chooses 2-5 cards from his/her deck. Teams score points for choosing the same pictures, and score extra points for putting the pictures in the same order (from most to least important).&#10;&#10;The board is used to keep track of the score, and to dictate how many pictures a team may select. First team to the end wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Compatibility 15th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zYE_qfgGOPHH9cKY_OY4fA__original/img/qRhdEbCImyQ58jXg3d96JWdHEoc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic336536.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zYE_qfgGOPHH9cKY_OY4fA__thumb/img/xnzLetqYVIbyjxPg_z8hKPOLN-I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic336536.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/2604","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"6","yearPublished":"1996","playingTime":"30","minPlayingTime":"30","maxPlayingTime":"30","bestAtCount":[6],"averageRating":"6.57377","averageWeight":"1.1111","boardGameRank":"3775","mechanics":["Simultaneous Action Selection","Team-Based Game"],"categories":["Card Game","Party Game","Word Game"],"designers":["Craig Browne (I)"]}}
