In addition to its other weapons, the Y-Wing makes use of an ion cannon that is capable of disabling enemy ships without destroying them. The staple of the Rebellion until the arrival of the X-Wing, this craft is still known as one of the most durable starfighters in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;If you are looking to add a rugged fighter to your squadron, look no further than the Y-Wing Expansion Pack, which includes Rebel squadron leader Horton Salm and three additional pilots. Designated as Gray Leader during the Battle of Endor, Salm is a crack shot, and even from long distances, he can nail his target. Upgrade his ship with an ion cannon, and temporarily gain the upper hand by incapacitating enemy ships.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w-EtaWynF9E6AW6p9lM3jQ__original/img/sQtfkMvScAi3XJbeCGaE2GJD47c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1324707.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w-EtaWynF9E6AW6p9lM3jQ__thumb/img/p84EEQKa8SpWLo2jYDlMXevyOmI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1324707.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/123763","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","yearPublished":"2012","playingTime":"20","minPlayingTime":"20","maxPlayingTime":"20","bestAtCount":[2],"averageRating":"7.73343","averageWeight":"2.3333","boardGameRank":"Not Ranked","mechanics":["Action Queue","Dice Rolling","Enclosure","Point to Point Movement","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],"categories":["Aviation / Flight","Expansion for Base-game","Miniatures","Movies / TV / Radio theme","Science Fiction","Wargame"],"designers":["Jay Little"]}}
