You are mining for copper and tin, attempting to sell when the prices are high. To reduce the cost of mining you can place developments, such as ports, adits, and trains. Once you have made your money you invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest the better the return.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__original/img/IQcVH_ftaU0vTLCO2HOHnIjiXm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic464133.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__thumb/img/GFKso8zlK2c73yUFCTdLITndS_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic464133.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/35570","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"4","bestAtCount":"4"}}
