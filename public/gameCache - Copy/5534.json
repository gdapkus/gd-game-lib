Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different &quot;strengths&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played in two stages. In the &quot;fast round&quot; players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby &quot;mining&quot; it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the &quot;scoring round&quot; begins.&#10;&#10;In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All &quot;1&quot; ships will fire, then all &quot;2&quot; ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful &quot;mining&quot; of the asteroid.&#10;&#10;Light Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;    2004 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zbqhNX9rCJ1jXuVuDf5y4g__original/img/ocbtPd87JVGcdBh7RLurWi9fD4o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic48676.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zbqhNX9rCJ1jXuVuDf5y4g__thumb/img/Dh3ihJYvtO1D56gPvuG-wkh94i0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic48676.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5534","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","bestAtCount":"4"}}
