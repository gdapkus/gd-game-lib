This version is significantly different from the original: it changes the encounter mix around, adds a deck of treasure clue cards, and expands the character selection with a dwarf and a &quot;hairfoot.&quot; The nice Darlene Pekul map painting is traded in for a hexmap with generic terrain symbols that Wham suggests you mount to cardboard and cut apart, thus creating a new map each game a la Kings &amp; Things. The cards force characters to move a lot more, and most encounters can no longer be given away, so this edition plays quite differently.&#10;&#10;&#10;For a complete list of Dragon Magazine games, check out this wiki:&#10;Dragon Magazine&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FvOMi3N9l_AwgdYvW1P9vw__original/img/WxCE7JlEXfKCz4Sg8WWTtzlV6Ho=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic21652.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FvOMi3N9l_AwgdYvW1P9vw__thumb/img/heyeqNV4qiy0kfGKtA1f2jAgntk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic21652.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/5811","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","bestAtCount":"1"}}
