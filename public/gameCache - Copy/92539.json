At the start of the game, each player takes a hand of four leaders and may play one at the start of each of the three Ages. Unlike the standard cards, leaders cost money (not resources). The expansion comes with a new Wonder&mdash;the ancient city of Rome&mdash;and contains 6-gold tokens made of cardboard for more efficient money-management.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8YmOOnFFI58OZ3bBM2A7w__original/img/t7h4GAsqZsTFnwJp7NgXR54iyUM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1046319.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8YmOOnFFI58OZ3bBM2A7w__thumb/img/CYxYfPhv5keaEOP1Q7JC3R3WxYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1046319.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/92539","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"7","bestAtCount":"4"}}
