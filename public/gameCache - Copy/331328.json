In the whisper-thin air the paths twist and shift as you climb, stranding the unprepared and confounding the overconfident. Do you have what it takes to summit this perilous peak?&#10;&#10;In Unsurmountable, players will be tackling the rocky slopes of an ever-changing mountain. As the game unfolds, they must place the next piece of the path carefully in order to complete a route to the top while simultaneously meeting any additional goals for the round. It may sound like a walk in the park, but this puzzle has plenty of pitfalls to keep players on their toes.&#10;&#10;Unsurmountable is the next title in our Simply Solo line, following Food Chain Island and Ugly Gryphon Inn. These titles were designed by Scott Almes for single-player only, focusing on elegant rules that create complex situations. Like the previous two games, Unsurmountable delivers a fun puzzle that&rsquo;s sure to hit the table again and again.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ONaHD5ZX_LnX2xdh0ClX_Q__original/img/Vg7pF1dRZzoAWyWRv444FP4hUJ8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6385752.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ONaHD5ZX_LnX2xdh0ClX_Q__thumb/img/895tpWUSEAbb1tf4ko0ZQWGxscY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6385752.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/331328","minPlayers":"1","maxPlayers":"1","bestAtCount":"1"}}
