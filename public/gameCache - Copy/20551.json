Each round, the players decide which of their actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube Tower plays the leading role: cubes (representing troops) from both sides are thrown in together, and those that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points at the end of the game becomes &ndash; SHOGUN!&#10;&#10;Shogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Wallenstein&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__original/img/Yu1D0BNyavkX_SV8EK056FxfRsw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3336315.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__thumb/img/BcVo6uokndgMSoFdIdEmgu-2C1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3336315.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/20551","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"5","bestAtCount":"4"}}
