When the fires of the revolution died down, a political game began to establish the only proper totalitarian regime. The players take the roles of animal dictators who will stop at nothing to gain absolute power over the global Farm.&#10;&#10;This is a negotiation game for 3 to 5 players that's based on the concept of forced cooperation. On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand &ndash; they are divided by the will to win. The game favors efficient strategy, slick negotiations and successful bluffing. At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends. All this makes each round of the game abound in heated talks (both public and secret), pacts, promises and betrayals. Special abilities drawn before the game, along with the winning conditions, guarantee that no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EZcxebcO-YKw6wGg8FHetg__original/img/GiAsdHMVqZCtoG-OMUl8EGwGltA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1471640.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EZcxebcO-YKw6wGg8FHetg__thumb/img/rogEjYA_S0a7OXgjO4eQx6h78-8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1471640.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/133537","minPlayers":"0","maxPlayers":"0","bestAtCount":null}}
