The Steam Barons rules introduce a stock-market system to the game. Now you can buy and sell shares in the railway companies. The biggest advantage of these rules is that the maps become playable by between two and six players.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 144 wooden train pieces which must be used with the Steam Barons version but can also be used with the base and standard games. An additional 38 tiles have also been included to avoid shortages with the larger maps.&#10;&#10;Similar to&#10;&#10;     Railways of England and Wales (for the stock market part)&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oe7MvYWJ7HYU22OODDcvdA__original/img/jBJahrA33qj1rwDLuhmN1dCkjOw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic561832.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oe7MvYWJ7HYU22OODDcvdA__thumb/img/4cqvIINiKunxQ7N9jZAJkMt7WHU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic561832.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/56890","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"6","bestAtCount":"4"}}
