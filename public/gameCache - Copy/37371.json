In this way, one makes the slices as equal as possible so that one does not end up with the short end. But this rule does not apply to &quot;...aber bitte mit Sahne (...but please, with whipped cream).&quot; Here a person can cleverly offer larger pieces to the others and still get the most in the end.&#10;&#10;5 cakes with 11 slices of different varieties are divided. Each variety awards a different amount of points. One can immediately eat slices to guarantee a number of points, or collect them in the hope of scoring bonus points for having the most of that variety at the end of the game. Only skilled dividers with an eye on their opponents&rsquo; pieces can score the most points and win the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0sx6y7s9v73PkQ-qToUkg__original/img/FV-UQn4S5PKQcxNpkxurnyuAhZ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic629711.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0sx6y7s9v73PkQ-qToUkg__thumb/img/g53Mi9_zmRYWo-c-Vi1IXQWGbQo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic629711.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/37371","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","bestAtCount":"4"}}
