Because of the pusher configuration, the DH2 has a flexible forward firing gun - a novel addition to the Ace of Aces system. The game also provides statistics for other early-war German aircraft and Allied pusher aircraft which may be played using this set.&#10;&#10;Flying Machines includes a different variety of maneuvers than was used in the Powerhouse and Handy Rotary books. This makes for interesting match-ups between the sets.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qlCNgaywm-fIvszDDbD9lw__original/img/qNDHsactNsQvZwNzY1FIk3DxQTc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic517636.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qlCNgaywm-fIvszDDbD9lw__thumb/img/h8pvMeBAgo2OvLEuGoV5IjyEoaY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic517636.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/7103","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"2","bestAtCount":"2"}}
