He showed us marvels beyond imagination and taught us how to use his strange machines. Now that the Traveler has vanished, a storm is coming. Who will control the destiny of the American Frontier?&quot;&#10;&#10;In 3000 Scoundrels, players assume the roles of rival leaders attempting to steal precious technology left behind by the Traveler. By overlaying clear cards, you create unique scoundrels and use them to outsmart your foes. In short, hire scoundrels to build powerful combos, steal technology, and outsmart your foes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you play a poker card from your hand face down in front of your player board, then use all abilities matching your claimed number. You don't need to tell the truth when claiming a number, but if an opponent catches you bluffing, it will damage your reputation and decrease your odds of winning the game.&#10;&#10;Each leader has a unique perspective and motivation in the conflict of Graystone Gulch. Are you driven by money, fame, or the deep-seated desire to improve the world? Advanced rules add unique strategies to each leader that reflect their unique strengths and cunning tricks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fd8roQmzMxMMxWVR07cybg__original/img/pNoBaSbc2KBb3dl51tMSUPzJ6eg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6978740.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fd8roQmzMxMMxWVR07cybg__thumb/img/0nudsXMheCPm_8f6bUg2TRaJqaI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6978740.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/367525","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"4","bestAtCount":"3"}}
