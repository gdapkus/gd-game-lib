The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.&#10;&#10;It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:&#10;- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles.&#10;- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.&#10;- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.&#10;- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.&#10;&#10;The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion&#10;&#10;In the 2020 edition &#10;- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now.&#10;- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows. &#10;- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end. Fishing huts likewise.&#10;- Players each get 3 huts instead of just 2.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSD4L9c-rY5OOlJYFlQ2Wg__original/img/pBCT2KKOuuSrj4OI5gybXzySnRo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5647234.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSD4L9c-rY5OOlJYFlQ2Wg__thumb/img/4jFZqbcMUlrd-Nhy7IJHjTshbrc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5647234.png","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/4390","minPlayers":"2","maxPlayers":"5","bestAtCount":"2"}}
