In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!&#10;&#10;Because One Night Ultimate Werewolf is so fast, fun, and engaging, you'll want to play it again and again, and no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;This game can be combined with One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Daybreak.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KLDb0vR3w8mfaHgIGF0gHw__original/img/9YTYFSMwiRA01ZRNG0R5e9Rq01E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1809823.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KLDb0vR3w8mfaHgIGF0gHw__thumb/img/ZgQsHsvdxXZr4DbMGUBSTArBp3o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1809823.jpg","link":"https://boardgamegeek.com/thing/147949","minPlayers":"3","maxPlayers":"10","bestAtCount":"6"}}
